      <h3 >Mock Wrap Scrubs for Women Workwear Revolution, Soft Stretch, Easy Care WW610, M, Navy</h3>
    </a>
    <br>
        <p>Firstly, I love the fact that these Mock Wrap Scrubs for Women from Workwear Revolution are available in sizes up to 5XL.</p>
<p>This means that no matter what your size, you can find scrubs that fit you perfectly.The fit is modern classic, which is flattering and comfortable.</p>
<p>The mock wrap design is not only stylish, but also comfortable and practical.The top is made from a smooth two-way stretch poly/rayon/spandex blend fine twill fabric, which is soft and durable.</p>
<p>The fabric is also machine washable, which is a big plus for anyone who works in a hospital or other healthcare setting.</p>
<p>The pockets on these scrubs are also a highlight.They are roomy enough to fit an iPhone or Galaxy phone, as well as other work gear.The hidden instrument loops inside the right pocket are also a nice touch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there isn't much that I dislike about these scrubs.However, if I had to pick something, I would say that the price could be a bit higher.Despite this, I would still recommend these scrubs to anyone looking for comfortable, durable, and stylish workwear.</p>
<p>Overall, I highly recommend these Mock Wrap Scrubs for Women from Workwear Revolution.The fit is perfect, the fabric is soft and durable, and the pockets are practical.These scrubs are comfortable enough to wear all day, and durable enough to withstand the demands of a hospital or other healthcare setting.</p>

<p>I absolutely love Scrubs, and watching the complete first season was an absolute delight.The show is hilarious, and the characters are so well-written and likable.The medical scenes are accurate enough to be informative, but not so much that they become boring or overly tedious.</p>
<p>The bonus features are also a nice touch, and the deleted scene in particular is worth watching.</p>
<p>There's not much to dislike about this box set.The only criticism I would have is that the bonus features could have been a little more extensive.A few more interviews with the cast and crew would have been nice, as well as a few more deleted scenes.</p>
<p>But overall, this is a great set and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves medical comedies or just wants to relive some classic TV moments.</p>
