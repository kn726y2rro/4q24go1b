<p>One of the most important features of a fan is its quiet operation, and the Igenix DF1210 Portable Desk Fan does not disappoint.</p>
<p>Despite its powerful airflow, this fan is incredibly quiet, making it perfect for use in a home or office setting.</p>
<p>The mesh grill on this fan is also a great feature.The grill provides added safety by preventing fingers from getting caught in the fan blades.This is particularly important for families with young children or for anyone who may not be as careful with their fingers.</p>
<p>Finally, the Igenix DF1210 Portable Desk Fan comes with a two-year warranty which can be registered online.</p>
<p>This warranty provides peace of mind for customers, knowing that if anything goes wrong with the fan, they can easily get a replacement or a refund.</p>
<p>Overall, the Igenix DF1210 Portable Desk Fan is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a powerful, quiet, and safe fan for their home or office.</p>
<p>The three speed settings, oscillating fan, and mesh grill make this fan a great value for the price.</p>

<p>This fan has 35W of power, which is perfect for large rooms and warehouses that get hot and stuffy.</p>
<p>The fan is super easy to use, as it has 3 settings, each one controls the speed.The 3 settings are adjusted by the speed regulator switch; 0 is when the fan is turned off, 1 is low speed, 2 is medium speed and 3 is high speed.</p>
<p>It is just a twist the speed regulator switch to get you feeling cool again.</p>
<p>The fan is stylishly designed with a chrome finish, which makes it perfect for any office, large room or warehouse.</p>
<p>The blades are also made of metal so they will not break as we have implemented a strong metal grill.</p>
<p>The fan is fully assembled and ready to use, you just need to plug it into the correct socket and start feeling cool again.</p>
<p>The fan is also adjustable up and down at 120, allowing you to position the fan exactly where you need it.</p>
<p>This is exceptionally good if you are needing the cold air to circulate.</p>
<p>The fan comes equipped with rubber feet which will allow it to stay steady and secure on any flat surface.</p>
<p>This will help a lot as many fans break by falling over or being knocked over, not this fan- this fan will stay upright until you move it.</p>
<p>However, please do not move the fan when it is running.It is safe to move the fan when it is not running.</p>
<p>Overall, the Metal Floor Fan 9" High Velocity Chrome Gym Free Stand Fan Cooling Fan Industrial Fan 3 Speed Desk Fan Table Fan Sturdy Housing High Airflow Powerful (9Inch) is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful and stylish fan that can keep their large room or warehouse cool.</p>
