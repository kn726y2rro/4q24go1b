    </a>
    <br>
        <p>As a pool owner, I know how tedious and time-consuming it can be to manually clean your pool.That's why I was excited to try out the AIPER Seagull SE Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner.This pool vacuum is completely cordless and hassle-free, making it the perfect solution for anyone looking to take the workload off their hands.</p>
<p>The Seagull SE is equipped with powerful dual-drive motors that track down and collect the most types of dirt and debris with ease.</p>
<p>This cleaner features two independent brushes that give your pool a deep clean.It is ideal for round above-ground pools (up to 33' diameter) and in-ground flat-rolled pools (up to 40' X 20').</p>
<p>One of the best features of this pool vacuum is its increased battery life.The newly designed battery only takes 2.5 hours to fully charge and provides over 90 minutes of cleaning capabilities.</p>
<p>This means you won't have to worry about constantly charging your pool vacuum and can enjoy a hassle-free cleaning experience.</p>
<p>The Seagull SE is a powerful and efficient pool vacuum that is easy to use.It automatically stops near the edge of your pool when the battery is low or when a cleaning cycle has been completed.</p>
<p>The included hook makes retrieving your Seagull SE simple without the need to get wet.</p>
