<p>Firstly, I love the versatility of the Lakeland Dual Basket Air Fryer - 9L.The separate cooking baskets allow for cooking food for larger or smaller groups, making it perfect for family dinners or entertaining friends.</p>
<p>The touchscreen display is easy to use, and the adjustable time and temperature settings make it simple to cook a variety of foods to perfection.</p>

<p>The only thing I would change about the Lakeland Dual Basket Air Fryer - 9L is the size of the baskets.</p>
<p>The 5.5 litre basket is a bit small for cooking larger quantities of food, and the 3.5 litre basket is a bit small for cooking smaller quantities.</p>
<p>Other than that, I really have no complaints about this air fryer.</p>
<p>Overall, the Lakeland Dual Basket Air Fryer - 9L is a great air fryer that offers versatility and ease of use.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an air fryer that can cook for larger or smaller groups and can cook a variety of foods, the Lakeland Dual Basket Air Fryer - 9L is definitely worth checking out.</p>
