        <p><h2>How to Choose the Best Keyboard Switches</h2></p><br><p><p>If you're a gamer or someone who spends a lot of time typing on a computer, you likely know that your keyboard switches can have a big impact on your experience. But with so many different types of switches available, how do you know which ones are the best for you? In this article, we'll explore some of the most common types of keyboard switches and help you decide which ones are right for you.</p></p><br><p><h3>Mechanical Switches</h3></p><br><p><p>Mechanical keyboard switches are the most common type of switch used in keyboards today. They come in a variety of types, including linear, tactile, and clicky switches. Linear switches are the most popular and provide a smooth, consistent feel. Tactile switches are more clicky and clicky switches are more pronounced.</p></p><br><p><h3>Membrane Switches</h3></p><br><p><p>Membrane switches are often used in gaming keyboards and provide a more tactile feel than mechanical switches. They also have a shorter travel distance, which can be beneficial for fast typing.</p></p><br><p><h3>Switch Type</h3></p><br><p><p>There are two main types of membrane switches: linear and tactile. Linear membrane switches are similar to linear mechanical switches and provide a smooth, consistent feel. Tactile membrane switches are more clicky and provide a more tactile feel.</p></p><br><p><h3>Switches with Cherry MX Switches</h3></p><br><p><p>Cherry MX switches are a popular choice for gaming keyboards and offer a wide range of types, including linear, tactile, and clicky switches. They are known for their durability and high-quality construction.</p></p><br><p><h3>Switch Modifications</h3></p><br><p><p>If you want to modify your keyboard switches, there are a variety of options available. You can replace the switches with different types or modify them yourself with custom keycaps or other modifications.</p></p><br><p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p><br><p><p>When choosing keyboard switches, it's important to consider your personal preferences and the type of keyboard you have. Mechanical switches are the most common type, but membrane switches offer a different feel and are popular among gamers. Cherry MX switches are known for their high-quality construction and durability, and modifications can be a fun way to personalize your keyboard.</p></p>

      <h3 >Akko CS Switches, 3 Pin 36gf Tactile Keyboard Switches Lavender Purple Key Switches Plate Mounted Compatible for MX Mechanical Keyboard (45 pcs)</h3>
    </a>
    <br>
        <p>As a reviewer, I have had the opportunity to try out the Akko CS Switches, 3 Pin 36gf Tactile Keyboard Switches Lavender Purple Key Switches Plate Mounted Compatible for MX Mechanical Keyboard (45 pcs).</p>
<p>And let me tell you, these switches are a game-changer.</p>
<p>Firstly, I love the design of these switches.The lavender purple color is beautiful and the plate mount design is very unique.The switches are made with a 18mm extension spring, which gives a unique tactile bump and smooth feedback.</p>
