        <p>As a reviewer, I have to say that the NUVISION LIGHTING NVL-HL-002 7 inches LED Headlight High Low Beam Compatible with 97-17 Jeep Wrangler JK TJ LJ CJ 18 Wrangler JK with Adapter Harness (Left &amp; Right) DOT Approved are an excellent upgrade for anyone looking to improve the lighting on their Jeep.</p>
<p>These headlights come with a complete pair, standard 3 blade connection, anti-flicker resistors, and are easy to install.</p>
<p>The light output is 6000K, and the headlights are IP67 waterproof.The lights are also DOT approved, which means they meet the safety requirements set by the Federal Motor Safety Standards.</p>
<p>One of the things that really stood out to me about these headlights is the fact that they are made with original Cree chips.</p>
<p>This means that they are brighter than the original headlight assembly, which is always a plus.They also come with a guarantee of over 80000 hours of lifespan, so you can rest assured that these headlights are going to last a long time.</p>
<p>In terms of installation, these headlights are real plug-and-play.They come with two adapter harnesses (H4 and H13), so all you have to do is connect the light to the factory wiring.</p>
<p>There is no need for any more wiring or modification, making the installation process quick and easy.</p>
<p>Overall, if you are looking to improve the lighting on your Jeep, I highly recommend the NUVISION LIGHTING NVL-HL-002 7 inches LED Headlight High Low Beam Compatible with 97-17 Jeep Wrangler JK TJ LJ CJ 18 Wrangler JK with Adapter Harness (Left &amp; Right) DOT Approved.</p>
<p>They are a high-quality product that will improve your driving safety and increase your visibility.</p>
