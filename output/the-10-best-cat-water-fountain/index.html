      <h3 >Veken 95oz/2.8L Pet Fountain, Automatic Cat Water Fountain Dog Water Dispenser with Smart Pump for Cats, Dogs, Multiple Pets (Grey, Plastic)</h3>
    </a>
    <br>
        <p>If you are like most pet owners, you want the best for your furry friends.And what better way to show your pet how much you care than by providing them with a clean, fresh water source at all times.</p>
<p>The Veken 95oz/2.8L Pet Fountain is an excellent choice for pet owners looking to keep their pets hydrated and healthy.</p>
<p>I absolutely love this pet fountain! The first thing that stood out to me was the large capacity.Staying hydrated is the key to preventing kidney and urinary tract diseases, and the 95oz capacity makes this pet fountain water dispenser a perfect fit for small to medium dog breeds and all cats.</p>
<p>The high-quality construction of this drinking fountain is also a major plus.It is made of food grade materials, is BPA free, and is durable and easy to operate and clean.The water-level window and LED Light let you observe how much water your pets drink in real time, and lets you see exactly when you need to fill the water bowl.</p>
<p>The switch on the wire to control the light makes it easy to turn it on or off.</p>
<p>The Veken Pet Fountain comes with two flow designs, the flower waterfall (faucet drinking) and the gentle fountain.</p>
<p>The water streaming down the petals of the flower on the fountain will draw your pets attention and encourage animals to drink more often.</p>
<p>In addition to keeping water fresh via circulation, the 4 stages system, including coconut shell activated carbon &amp; cotton layer, ion exchange resin and thick non-woven fabric, keeps water better tasting and safer for pets.</p>
<p>The ultra-quiet pump on this water dispenser is another feature that I love.It has low-energy consumption and will last 1.5-2 years.</p>
<p>Overall, I highly recommend the Veken 95oz/2.8L Pet Fountain.It is an excellent choice for pet owners looking to keep their pets hydrated and healthy.With its large capacity, high-quality construction, two flow designs, and 4 stages filtration system, this water dispenser is sure to be a hit with your furry friends.</p>
