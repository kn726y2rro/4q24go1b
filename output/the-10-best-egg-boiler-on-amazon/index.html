        <ul>
<li><strong>Delicious Eggs Just the Way You Like It:</strong> The Duronic EB35 egg boiler revolutionizes the way we eat eggs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional electric egg boilers only have a simple "On/Off" switch which doesn't take into account people's preferences on soft, medium or hard boiled eggs.</p>
<p>With this egg boiler, you can choose the exact texture of your egg with the timer function.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Includes an Egg Piercer Built onto the Measuring Cup:</strong> Never lose your egg piercer again as this egg piercer is built onto the measuring cup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eggs should be pierced on the larger side to keep the shell from cracking during boiling. Don't pierce the small side, nor pierce both sides of the egg; only one side for the best results in boiled eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buzzer &amp; Reheat Function:</strong> By putting the consumer in our minds, we've built the low and high reheat function to help you reheat eggs if not consumed on first go, or to cook that extra bit more if you like your eggs really hard.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beeping alarm function will notify you when the eggs are ready, so you can consume them when they're just off the boil; all fresh and deliciously hot.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beautifully Constructed:</strong> The egg boiling machine is beautifully constructed with a stainless steel finish with white to make it stand out in any kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boil between 1-7 eggs with ease thanks to the easy pull-out egg tray with handle for easy carrying.</p>
<p>The transparent lid allows for easy observation while your eggs are being cooked to perfection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality Never Compromised:</strong> A simple red light has been built into the unit so you always know whether the unit is powered on or off -- saving you electricity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The timer function saves electricity by not cooking longer than needed. This egg boiler keeps you in control so you get the perfect eggs every time.</p>
