      <h3 >Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil For Healthy Hair Growth, 2 oz (59ml)</h3>
    </a>
    <br>
        <p>If you're looking for an oil that can help you achieve thicker, healthier hair, then Mielle's Rosemary Mint Scalp &amp; Hair Strengthening Oil is definitely worth considering.</p>
<p>This oil is made with more than 20 natural oils and ingredients, including rosemary, mint, and biotin, which work together to promote hair growth and prevent dryness of the scalp.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I love the natural ingredients used in this oil.The blend of rosemary, mint, and biotin is perfect for promoting healthy hair growth, and the fact that it's free from harsh chemicals makes it a safer option for hair care.</p>
<p>The oil itself is lightweight and non-greasy, which means it can be easily absorbed into the scalp and hair follicles.</p>
<p>While I love the natural ingredients used in this oil, I wish it came in a larger bottle.At 2oz, it's a bit on the small side, especially considering the price.Additionally, the scent of the oil is a bit too strong for my taste, so I would prefer a milder scent.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this oil is a great option for anyone looking to promote healthy hair growth.The natural ingredients used are effective, and the oil itself is lightweight and non-greasy.However, I wish it came in a larger bottle and had a milder scent.If you're willing to overlook these minor issues, then I highly recommend giving Mielle's Rosemary Mint Scalp &amp; Hair Strengthening Oil a try.</p>
