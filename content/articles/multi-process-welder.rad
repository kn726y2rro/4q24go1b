In this article, we will go over some of the factors to consider when making your decision.\n## Types of Multi Process Welders\nThere are two main types of multi process welders: MIG and TIG. MIG welders use wire feeders to deliver wire, while TIG welders use a gas lens to deliver gas and wire. Both types of welders can be used for a variety of applications, including welding aluminum, steel, and stainless steel.\n## Features to Consider\nBefore choosing a multi process welder, there are a few features to consider. These include:\n### Duty Cycle\nThe duty cycle is the amount of time the welder can be used in a row before it needs to cool down. A higher duty cycle means the welder can be used for longer periods of time.\n### Amperage\nThe amperage is the maximum amount of current the welder can supply. A higher amperage means the welder can be used for thicker materials.\n### Wire Feed Rate\nThe wire feed rate is how quickly the wire is fed into the weld. A higher wire feed rate means the welder can be used for faster welding.\n### Weight\nIf you plan to move the welder around frequently, it's important to consider its weight. Heavy welders can be difficult to transport.\n## Conclusion\nWhen choosing a multi process welder, it's important to consider the types of welding you plan to do, the features you need, and the weight and portability of the welder. By taking these factors into account, you can choose the best multi process welder for your needs.", "cool_products": [{"title": "TOOLIOM Aluminum MIG Welder 250A 110V/220V Dual Voltage MIG/Lift TIG/Stick 3 in 1 Welding Machine", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HZYLJDX?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "TOOLIOM", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51v8ZYMoeTL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51v8ZYMoeTL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51v8ZYMoeTL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Forney Easy Weld 140 MP, Multi-Process Welder", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078V852S2?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Forney", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lXFP6UooL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lXFP6UooL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lXFP6UooL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "ARCCAPTAIN MIG Welder, 200Amp 6 in 1 Gas MIG/Gasless Flux Core MIG/Stick/Lift TIG/Spot welding/Spool Gun 110V/200V Aluminum Multi Process Welding Machine with LED Digital Display, Burn Back Adjustment", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1TGZ8XN?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "ARCCAPTAIN", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41R2CsjastL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41R2CsjastL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41R2CsjastL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Weldpro 155 Amp Inverter MIG/Stick Arc Welder with Dual Voltage 240V/120V welding machine, spool gun capable", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H1GJFV9?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "W Weldpro", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414KDySamKL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414KDySamKL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414KDySamKL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "ESAB EMP 210 Multi Process Welder MIG/STICK/TIG, 200A, 120/230V DC", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KMH2CGQ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "ESAB", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fmjiOy8gL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fmjiOy8gL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fmjiOy8gL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Weldpro 200 Amp Inverter Multi Process Welder with 3 Year Warranty Dual Voltage 220V/110V Mig/Tig/Arc Stick 3 in 1 welder/welding machine", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072S5J17X?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "W Weldpro", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xFoI+lGpL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xFoI+lGpL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xFoI+lGpL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "YESWELDER 135Amp MIG Welder,110V Flux Core Welder Flux MIG/Lift TIG/Stick 3-in-1 Welding Machine IGBT Inverter Welder", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CBBHFX5?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "YESWELDER", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HMsAcmcrL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HMsAcmcrL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HMsAcmcrL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "ANDELI Plasma Cutter Mig Welder Combo,200 Amp 220V Inverter 5 in 1 Multi Process Welder Mig/Stick/Tig/Cold/CUT Welder Welding Machine", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BVLXMMW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "ANDELI", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ck6Fi4j4L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ck6Fi4j4L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ck6Fi4j4L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "SSIMDER Aluminum MIG Welder Pulse MIG/MAG/HF TIG/Stick/CUT Welding Machine SD4050Pro 10 in 1 Welder", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9T1CYJG?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "S SIMDER", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ur7hSOXvL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ur7hSOXvL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ur7hSOXvL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "S7 200Amp MIG Welder -
