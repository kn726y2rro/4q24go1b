However, with the right knowledge and guidance, finding affordable yet high-quality headphones is possible. In this article, we'll cover some key factors to consider when choosing your next set of headphones, as well as provide recommendations for some of the best cheap headphones available today.\n## Factors to Consider\nWhen shopping for cheap headphones, there are several important factors to consider before making a purchase. Here are some of the most important ones:\n1. **Sound Quality**: The most crucial factor to consider when choosing inexpensive headphones is sound quality. While cheaper headphones may sacrifice some features like noise cancellation or bass boost, they should still deliver clear and accurate audio. Look for headphones that have a frequency response of at least 20Hz-20kHz and a sensitivity rating of at least 85dB.\n2. **Comfort**: Comfort is another essential consideration. Cheap headphones often come with lightweight designs and adjustable headbands to ensure a comfortable fit for long listening sessions. Look for headphones with soft earpads and cushions that don't press into your ears after extended use.\n3. **Noise Cancellation**: If you plan to use your headphones for travel, work, or other noisy environments, look for models with active noise cancellation (ANC) technology. This feature blocks out external sounds, allowing you to focus on your music without distractions.\n4. **Connectivity Options**: Wireless connectivity is becoming increasingly popular among budget headphones, offering convenience and flexibility. Look for Bluetooth headphones with a range of up to 30 feet and a battery life of at least 8 hours.\n5. **Design**: Finally, consider design aesthetics. While function is paramount, stylish and sleek headphones can enhance your overall look while providing excellent audio performance.\n## Recommendations\nNow that we've covered some key factors to consider, let's take a look at some of our top picks for the best cheap headphones under $100:\n### 1. Sony WH-CH510N Wireless Headphones\nThe Sony WH-CH510N wireless headphones offer exceptional sound quality, ANC capabilities, and a sleek design all at an affordable price point.

Additionally, their foldable design makes them easy to transport and store, and their wireless connectivity offers seamless pairing with your smartphone or other devices. \n### 2.

These buds deliver crystal-clear audio with active noise cancellation, and their sleek design fits comfortably in your ears for extended wear.
