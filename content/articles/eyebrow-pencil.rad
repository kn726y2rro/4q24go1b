Whether you want to enhance your natural brows or create a bold and bold look, an eyebrow pencil is the perfect tool to help you achieve your desired look. In this article, we will discuss how to choose the best eyebrow pencil for your needs.\n## Types of Eyebrow Pencils\nThere are two main types of eyebrow pencils: wax-based and powder-based. Wax-based pencils are softer and more creamy, while powder-based pencils are harder and more waxy. Both types of pencils can be used to fill in brows, but they have different benefits and drawbacks.\n### Wax-Based Pencils\nWax-based pencils are great for those who have sparse or unruly brows. They are softer and more creamy, which makes them easier to apply and blend. They also tend to last longer than powder-based pencils. However, they can be difficult to remove and can be messy if you are not careful.\n### Powder-Based Pencils\nPowder-based pencils are great for those who want a more controlled and precise application. They are harder and more waxy, which makes them easier to apply and blend. They also tend to last longer than wax-based pencils. However, they can be difficult to remove and can be messy if you are not careful.\n## Brands\nThere are many different brands of eyebrow pencils available on the market, but not all brands are created equal. Some brands are more expensive than others, but it is important to choose a brand that is reputable and well-known for producing high-quality products. Some popular brands of eyebrow pencils include Anastasia Beverly Hills, Kat Von D, and Maybelline.\n## Application\nWhen applying eyebrow pencil, it is important to use a fine brush to fill in your brows. Start by filling in any sparse areas with light strokes, then blend the color with a spoolie brush. Be sure to blend the color well, as you do not want to end up with obvious lines or patches.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best eyebrow pencil can be a daunting task, but with the right knowledge and tools, you can achieve the brows of your dreams. Whether you prefer wax-based or powder-based pencils, or you prefer a specific brand, it is important to choose a product that will work well for your needs. With the right product and application techniques, you can achieve the brows of your dreams.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Wet n Wild Ultimate Eyebrow Retractable Definer Pencil, Medium Brown, Dual-Sided Brow Brush, Fine Tip, Shapes, Defines, Fills Brow Makeup", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078KB7L4G?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "wet n wild", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31QF5SK3tzL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31QF5SK3tzL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31QF5SK3tzL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Micro Brow Pencil, Eyebrow Pencil, Espresso, 1 Count", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WZQTCS8?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41u9frIaUdL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41u9frIaUdL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41u9frIaUdL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Makeup Brow Stylist Definer Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil, Ultra-Fine Mechanical Pencil, Draws Tiny Brow Hairs and Fills in Sparse Areas and Gaps, Brunette, 0.003 Ounce (Pack of 2)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769PK7D7?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xpawjQD6L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xpawjQD6L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xpawjQD6L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Maybelline New York Total Temptation Eyebrow Definer Pencil, Blonde, 1 Count", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VD6LCB?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "MAYBELLINE", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Hd6TRe6XL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Hd6TRe6XL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Hd6TRe6XL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "e.l.f., Instant Lift Brow Pencil, Dual-Sided, Precise, Fine Tip, Shapes, Defines, Fills Brows, Contours, Combs, Tames, Neutral Brown, 0.006 Oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WAJAKOU?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "e.l.f.", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/216EkPgD46L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/216EkPgD46L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/216EkPgD46L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Micro Eyebrow Retractable Pencil, Soft Brown, Ultra Fine 1.5mm Tip, Draws Tiny Brow Hairs", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QGB69GS?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "wet n wild", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/312wCx4IxsL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/312wCx4IxsL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/312wCx4IxsL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Eyebrow Pencil by Revlon, Colorstay Eye Makeup with Eyebrow Spoolie, Waterproof, Longwearing Angled Precision Tip, 205 Blonde, 0.01 Oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KHSV57Q?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "REVLON", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21oFo2Vd0RL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21oFo2Vd0RL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21oFo2Vd0RL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Maybelline New York Brow Ultra Slim Defining Eyebrow Pencil, Black Brown, 0.003 oz.", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PDMZB45?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "MAYBELLINE", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OJHAzmzBL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OJHAzmzBL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OJHAzmzBL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Benefit Precisely My Brow Pencil (Ultra Fine Brow Defining Pencil) - # 6 (Deep) 0.08g/0.002oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004HAGE54?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Benefit", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21lzoTzcIaL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21lzoTzcIaL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21lzoTzcIaL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Eyebrow Pencil By Wet n Wild Brow-Sessive Brow Makeup Pencil Liner Blending Brush, Precise, Fine Tip, Shapes, Defines, Fills, Dark Brown", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RRRRXKG?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "wet n wild", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ppgrxkRGL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ppgrxkRGL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ppgrxkRGL._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [":\n        If you're looking for a brow pencil that will give you perfectly shaped and defined brows, look no further than Wet n Wild Ultimate Eyebrow Retractable Definer Pencil.
