Not only do they provide support and compression, but they also help to keep you comfortable and dry during your workout. Whether you're a casual runner or a serious competitor, it's important to choose the right pair of leggings to help you perform your best. In this article, we'll go over some tips for how to choose the best running leggings for your needs.\n### Consider the Material\nThe first thing you'll want to consider when shopping for running leggings is the material they're made from. You want to look for leggings that are made from a stretchy, moisture-wicking fabric that will keep you comfortable and dry throughout your workout. Some popular materials for running leggings include polyester, spandex, and nylon.\n### Look for Support\nIf you're planning on running long distances, you'll want to look for leggings that provide support for your lower body. Look for leggings that have a high level of compression and are designed to help improve your circulation and prevent muscle fatigue. Some leggings also feature supportive bands or panels that can help improve your posture and alignment while running.\n### Consider the Design\nWhen it comes to design, you'll want to look for leggings that are flattering and stylish, but also functional. Some leggings feature fun patterns or designs, while others are more basic and simple. Look for leggings that fit well and are comfortable to wear.\n### Price\nFinally, you'll want to consider the price of the leggings you're considering. While it's important to invest in a good pair of leggings, you don't want to spend too much if you're not going to be using them regularly. Look for leggings that offer good quality and support at a reasonable price.\nBy following these tips, you can choose the best running leggings for your needs and help you perform your best during your workouts.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Under Armour womens Heatgear Armour High No-slip Waistband Ankle Leggings , Black (001)/White , Medium", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874W4WS5?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Under Armour", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31efqPr3P9L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31efqPr3P9L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31efqPr3P9L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "THE GYM PEOPLE Thick High Waist Yoga Pants with Pockets, Tummy Control Workout Running Yoga Leggings for Women (Large, Black \u00a0)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HQM6NH8?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "THE GYM PEOPLE", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31AJQdWeWDL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31AJQdWeWDL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31AJQdWeWDL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Under Armour Women's HeatGear Armour High No-Slip Waistband Pocketed Leggings , Black (001)/White , Small", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874X3838?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Under Armour", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i4ki8AAkL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i4ki8AAkL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i4ki8AAkL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Fengbay 2 Pack High Waist Yoga Pants, Pocket Yoga Pants Tummy Control Workout Running 4 Way Stretch Yoga Leggings", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PG9ZZDL?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Fengbay", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/319MhXzQgPS._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/319MhXzQgPS._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/319MhXzQgPS._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "CRZ YOGA Women's Naked Feeling Workout Leggings 25 Inches -
