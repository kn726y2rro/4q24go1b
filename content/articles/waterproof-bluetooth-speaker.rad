Look for a speaker that is made from high-quality materials like rubber, silicone, or stainless steel. Additionally, a durable speaker will be designed with waterproof seals and protective coatings to ensure that it can withstand prolonged exposure to water without leaking or malfunctioning.\n## Sound Quality\nWhile durability is important, it's also important to consider the sound quality of a waterproof Bluetooth speaker.

Additionally, look for a speaker that has good battery life, so that you can enjoy your music for longer without needing to recharge.\n## Connectivity\nWhen choosing a waterproof Bluetooth speaker, it's important to consider the connectivity options. Look for a speaker that is compatible with a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Additionally, some speakers offer additional connectivity options like Wi-Fi or NFC, which can provide even more flexibility and convenience.\n## Price\nFinally, it's important to consider the price of a waterproof Bluetooth speaker. While some high-end models may offer the best sound quality and durability, they can also be quite expensive. Look for a speaker that offers good value for your budget, without sacrificing on quality or features.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best waterproof Bluetooth speaker will depend on your specific needs and preferences. By considering factors like design and durability, sound quality, connectivity, and price, you can find a waterproof Bluetooth speaker that meets your needs and budget.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker with 12W Stereo Sound, BassUp, IPX7 Waterproof, 24-Hour Playtime, Wireless Stereo Pairing, Speaker for Home, Outdoors, Travel", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01MTB55WH?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Anker", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41JEw1YrYUL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41JEw1YrYUL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41JEw1YrYUL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Sony SRS-XB13 - Compact & Portable Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth\u00ae speaker with EXTRA BASS\u2122 - Blue", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08YDZRXGN?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Sony", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Uo4Ic6UaL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Uo4Ic6UaL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Uo4Ic6UaL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "RIENOK Bluetooth Speaker Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 30W Enhanced Bass IPX7 Waterproof Bluetooth 5.3 Outdoor Speaker for Travel Sport", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09ZQF5GZW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "RIENOK", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lwn+-mCoL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lwn+-mCoL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lwn+-mCoL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "EWA Travel Case Packed, A106 Pro Wireless Mini Bluetooth Speaker with Custom Bass Radiator.
