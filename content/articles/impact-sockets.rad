They are used to connect and disconnect sockets from the drive end of the tool. Impact sockets come in different sizes and types, and choosing the right one can make a big difference in the efficiency and safety of your work. In this article, we'll discuss how to choose the best impact sockets for your needs.\n## Types of Impact Sockets\nThere are two main types of impact sockets: standard and deep well. Standard impact sockets are designed to fit standard drill and impact driver chucks. They have a shallow well that allows for easy bit changes, but they may not provide enough grip on deep-grooved fasteners. Deep well impact sockets have a deeper well that provides better grip on fasteners with deep grooves. They are generally used with impact drivers, but they can also be used with drills in certain situations.\n## Sizes of Impact Sockets\nImpact sockets come in different sizes, depending on the size of the fastener you're working with. You'll want to choose a socket that is slightly larger than the fastener head, but not so large that it's difficult to tighten. For example, if you're working with a #10 fastener, you'll want to choose an impact socket that's about 1/4\" larger than the head of the fastener.\n## Drive Type\nImpact sockets come in square drive and hex drive types. Square drive impact sockets are commonly used with drills, while hex drive impact sockets are commonly used with impact drivers. If you plan on using your impact socket with both drills and impact drivers, it's best to choose a socket that can accept both drive types.\n## Material\nImpact sockets are made from different materials, including steel and alloy steel. Steel impact sockets are generally the most durable, but they can be more expensive than alloy steel sockets. Alloy steel impact sockets are less expensive and more durable than steel sockets, but they may not last as long as steel sockets.\n## Conclusion\nChoosing the right impact socket for your needs can make a big difference in the efficiency and safety of your work. When choosing an impact socket, it's important to consider the size, type, drive type, and material. By following these guidelines, you can choose the best impact socket for your needs and get the job done right.", "cool_products": [{"title": "NefLaca 1/2\" Impact Deep Socket Set 10Pcs 10-24mm Durable Reliable Drive Cr-Mo Steel for Professional Repair DIY Tasks with Carrying Case", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09YXXWF1K?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "NefLaca", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ww-YwaaEL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ww-YwaaEL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ww-YwaaEL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "US PRO 16PC 1/2'' Dr 6-Point European Deep Impact Socket Set B1340", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00SDCOFZS?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "US PRO", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+xzWaDLiL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+xzWaDLiL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+xzWaDLiL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "US PRO 13pc 1/2\"\" Drive Deep Impact Socket Set Metric 13mm to 32mm 1397", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B077Z95SWQ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Bergen", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i6ZAJcSmL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i6ZAJcSmL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i6ZAJcSmL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Impact Socket Set 1/2-Inch, ginour 19PCS Drive Master Deep Impact Socket Set 8mm - 24mm, Metric, CR-V, 6 Point, with 3pcs Drive Impact Extension Bar Set 3\", 5\",10\"", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B082Y79KRY?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Ginour", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LLWtJ3g4L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LLWtJ3g4L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LLWtJ3g4L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Impact Socket Adapter Set 3\" Extension bit, (1/4\" 1/2\" 3/8\" Hex Drive) Power Drill Socket Converter for Impact Torque Wrench, Turn Cordless Power Drill Into Nut Driver for Automotive, and Tool Kits", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MH3MGGF?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "LEXIVON", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31iDJoDG8yL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31iDJoDG8yL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31iDJoDG8yL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Draper 63415 1/2\" Square Drive Impact Socket 15 Piece Set in 1/4 Eva Insert Tray , Blue", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B077Q4J7L1?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Draper", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wO1k7CKrL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wO1k7CKrL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wO1k7CKrL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "35pcs 1/2\" Drive 6 Point 8-32mm Metric Deep Impact Socket Set Car Garage Tools", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07SWHKBN3?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "DAYUAN", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Cb5bFJDhL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Cb5bFJDhL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Cb5bFJDhL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Alloy Wheel Impact Socket Set 5pc 1/2\"Sq Drive", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08H89GMTC?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "TOPWAY", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KborlicOL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KborlicOL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KborlicOL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "US Pro 14Piece Impact sockets, 1/2 10-32 mm Shallow Socket Set", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B077KCQRJB?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "US PRO", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Wgz-mg92L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Wgz-mg92L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Wgz-mg92L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "DAYUAN 1/2\" Drive Impact Deep Socket Set 10Pcs 10-24mm Drive Cr-Mo Steel for Automotive and DIY Tasks", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09Z24WJZG?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "DAYUAN", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41rjLcM-OkL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41rjLcM-OkL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41rjLcM-OkL._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [":\n# NefLaca 1/2\" Impact Deep Socket Set 10Pcs 10-24mm Durable Reliable Drive Cr-Mo Steel for Professional Repair DIY Tasks with Carrying Case\nIf you are looking for a high-quality socket set that is durable, reliable, and versatile, then the NefLaca 1/2\" Impact Deep Socket Set 10Pcs 10-24mm is definitely worth considering.
