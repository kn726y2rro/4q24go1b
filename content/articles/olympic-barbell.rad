One piece of equipment that you cannot overlook is an Olympic barbell. It's one of the most important pieces of equipment used in weightlifting, and choosing the right one can make a huge difference in your training experience. In this guide, we'll go over some factors to consider when choosing the best Olympic barbell.\n## Factors To Consider When Choosing An Olympic Barbell\n1. Weight Capacity: The first thing you need to consider is the weight capacity of the barbell. If you're planning on lifting heavy weights, then you want a barbell with a high weight capacity. A good rule of thumb is to choose a barbell that can support at least 25% of your body weight. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, then you should look for a barbell that can handle at least 37.5 pounds (150 x 0.25).\n2. Material: Another factor to consider is the material used to make the barbell. Steel is the most common material used for Olympic bars because it's durable and resistant to wear and tear. However, some people prefer rubber coated bars because they offer better grip and reduce the risk of injury.\n3. Length And Width: The length and width of the barbell are also important considerations. A standard Olympic bar is 28 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. However, if you have large hands or plan on doing power cleans, then you may want to opt for a wider bar. Some bars come in different widths such as 2.5\", 2.75\" and 3\".\n4. Grip: Finally, you want to consider the grips on the barbell. Most bars come with knurling or ribbing on the handles to provide a good grip. However, if you have large hands, you might want to consider a bar with larger grips.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best Olympic barbell depends on several factors such as weight capacity, material, length and width, and grip. By considering these factors, you can find a barbell that suits your needs and helps you achieve your fitness goals.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Dripex 7ft Olympic Barbell Bar - Standard Weight Bar Weight Lifting Barbell for 2 Inch Weights Plates with Collars | Chrome, Anti-Slip Hand Grip, Solid Steel, Gym Equipment", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08X4F12PV?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Dripex", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qeFysambL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qeFysambL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qeFysambL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Big Jim Olympic Barbell 7ft, 20kg Bar, 28mm Bar Diameter, Lift Up to 320kg Weights Set (Black and Chrome)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08BYLQ4SW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Big Jim", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31PmrwWel0L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31PmrwWel0L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31PmrwWel0L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Bonnlo Olympic Bar, 5 Ft Barbell for 2\" Weight Plates, 25mm Grip 500 lbs Capacity Bar Bench Press Chrome with Rotating Sleeve 13/20kg Straight Bar for Home Gym Fitness", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09962L1KB?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Bonnlo", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31GpDQM+RAL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31GpDQM+RAL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31GpDQM+RAL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "7ft Olympic Barbell Weight Set Tri-Grip Olympic Weight Plates 85kg total Cast Iron Rubber Coated (2.5kg+5kg+10kg+15kg Pair with 7ft Barbell)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BL8CRRRD?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "AD Fitness", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QihkSzecL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QihkSzecL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QihkSzecL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Strongway\u00ae 20KG 7FT Olympic Bar (700LBS/320KG Rated) Barbell Weight Lifting Barbell Chrome", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08D8FR9F3?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Strongway", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ZfM7TtXIL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ZfM7TtXIL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ZfM7TtXIL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "JLL\u00ae 2\u201d Olympic Straight Barbell Weight Lifting Bar - 6ft (6FT)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01BLEZAQM?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "JLL", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Wq4aaDvCL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Wq4aaDvCL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Wq4aaDvCL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "MAXSTRENGTH Olympic 2\" Barbell Bar With Spring Lock Collars ideal for Weight Lifting Bodybuilding Chrome Mens Workout Fitness Training Heavy Duty Exercise Equipment (5ft)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08T9WW2H2?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "MAXSTRENGTH", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414C83a2+QL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414C83a2+QL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414C83a2+QL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "GYM MASTER 2\" Diameter Olympic Barbell with Spring Clip Collars, Choice of Sizes - 5ft", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08B395YP7?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "GYM MASTER", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BzbpHpfEL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BzbpHpfEL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BzbpHpfEL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Marcy Olympic Weight Set - 105kg - 7ft Steel Barbell 20kg & 85kg Weight Plate Set in Silver-Grey Hammertone Finish", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B075Z29SCK?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "MARCY", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41efFICQOTL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41efFICQOTL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41efFICQOTL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Body Revolution Olympic Barbell Bar - Olympic Weight Lifting Bar for 2 Inch Weight Plates - Professional Barbell for Bench Press, Squats, Curls, Deadlifts, Powerlifting - Spring Collars - Range from 4ft - 7ft", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01H22H560?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Body Revolution", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wmsBvMvwL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wmsBvMvwL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wmsBvMvwL._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [": \nIf you're looking for a high-quality weightlifting barbell that's both durable and versatile, look no further than the Dripex 7ft Olympic Barbell Bar!
