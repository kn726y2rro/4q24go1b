Electric shavers are a convenient and easy way to achieve a smooth and flawless shave, but with so many options available in the market, it can be challenging to choose the right one for your needs. Here are some tips to help you choose the best men's electric shavers:\n### 1. Determine your shaving needs\nBefore you start shopping for an electric shaver, it's essential to determine your shaving needs. If you have a sensitive skin or you're looking for a shaver that can handle long beards, then you might want to consider a shaver with a sensitive skin mode or a shaver with a long-life battery. On the other hand, if you want a quick and easy shaving experience, then you might want to consider a shaver with a quick charge feature or a shaver with a cleaning and maintenance system.\n### 2. Consider the blade type\nAnother important factor to consider when choosing a men's electric shaver is the blade type. There are two types of blades: foil and rotary. Foil shavers are more popular as they are easier to maintain and clean. They also provide a close and comfortable shave. Rotary shavers, on the other hand, are more suitable for men with thick beards as they provide a more aggressive shave.\n### 3. Check the battery life\nIf you're going to use your electric shaver on a daily basis, then you might want to consider a shaver with a long-life battery. This will ensure that you can use it for a longer period without having to recharge it.\n### 4. Read reviews\nThe best way to get information about a product is to read reviews from other users. This will help you get an idea of the product's performance, durability, and usability.\nBy following these tips, you can choose the best men's electric shavers that suit your needs and preferences. Remember to do your research, read reviews, and try out the product before making a purchase.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Philips Shaver Series 3000 Dry and Wet Electric Shaver (Model S3233/52), Shiny Black, 2 pin plug", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ZQH4VSC?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "PHILIPS", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41DokiuF8jL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41DokiuF8jL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41DokiuF8jL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Electric Shavers Men Rechargeable -
