These hair pieces are made from real human hair and can be styled and colored to match your own hair. However, with so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right one. In this article, we will discuss the key factors to consider when selecting a human hair topper.\n### Consider Your Hair Type\nThe first thing to consider is your hair type. Human hair toppers come in different styles and colors, and it's important to choose one that matches your hair type. For example, if you have fine hair, you may want to choose a topper with thicker strands of hair. Alternatively, if you have curly hair, you may want to choose a topper with loose waves or curls.\n### Look for High-Quality Hair\nAnother important factor to consider is the quality of the hair used in the topper. You want to choose a topper that uses real human hair, as synthetic hair tends to look unnatural and fake. Look for a topper that uses high-quality hair that is silky smooth and has a natural look.\n### Choose the Right Size\nIt's important to choose the right size of human hair topper for your hair. The topper should be slightly larger than your head, and the hair should be slightly longer than your natural hair. This will give the topper a natural look and will blend with your hair seamlessly.\n### Consider the Style and Color\nFinally, consider the style and color of the human hair topper. You want to choose a style that complements your hair and style, and a color that matches your natural hair. You can choose a topper with loose waves, curls, or straight strands, and you can choose a color that matches your natural hair or a color that you want to try.\nIn conclusion, choosing a human hair topper can be a daunting task, but by considering your hair type, the quality of the hair, the size, and the style and color, you can choose a topper that will look natural and blend seamlessly with your hair.", "cool_products": [{"title": "MORICHY Biological Skin Scalp Hair Toppers for Women Real Human Hair,Fix Hair Loss Short Hair Toppers Pieces for Women with Thinning Hair", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C68VTN15?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "MORICHY", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518HrSD8eiL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518HrSD8eiL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518HrSD8eiL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "UDU Hair Toppers for Women Real Human Hair Toppers Hair Pieces for Women with Thinning Hair Ombre Highlights Hair Toppers Hair Pieces for Women Blonde Real Hair Toppers For Women For Thinning Hair", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8CFHZRW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "UDU", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513+0DDkjbL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513+0DDkjbL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513+0DDkjbL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "HAIRCUBE Human Hair Toppers For Women, 100% Remy Human Hair Topper With Bangs, 150% Density Silk Base Clip In Topper 14 inch 40g -
