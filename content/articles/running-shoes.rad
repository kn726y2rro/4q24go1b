Your shoes should provide you with the necessary support and comfort to help you perform your best. However, with so many different brands and models on the market, it can be difficult to know which ones to choose. In this article, we will go over some of the key factors to consider when choosing the best running shoes.\n## Determine Your Foot Type\nThe first step in choosing the best running shoes is to determine your foot type. There are three main types of feet: neutral, underpronators, and overpronators. Neutral feet land directly on the heel and forefoot. Underpronators have a mild inward roll in their feet, while overpronators have a more severe inward roll.\n## Look for the Right Cushioning\nDifferent types of feet require different levels of cushioning. Neutral feet require less cushioning, while overpronators require more. Look for shoes with cushioning that is specific to your foot type. For example, shoes designed for overpronators will typically have more cushioning and support in the heel.\n## Consider the Weight\nWeight is also an important factor to consider when choosing the best running shoes. Heavier shoes are generally better for long distance running, while lighter shoes are better for short runs and speed work. However, don't sacrifice comfort and support for weight.\n## Choose the Right Fit\nIt's important to choose a shoe that fits properly. Your shoe should fit snugly and not too loose or tight. Your toes should have a little room to wiggle, but not so much room that your feet move around inside the shoe.\n## Shop Around\nDon't just buy your running shoes from one store. Shop around and compare prices from different stores and brands. This will help you find the best deal and ensure that you are getting a quality product.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best running shoes is essential for any runner. By considering your foot type, cushioning, weight, fit, and shopping around, you can find the perfect pair of shoes to help you perform your best.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Under Armour mens Charged Assert 9 Running Shoe, Black (003 Black, 9.5 US", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B087T8Q2C4?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Under Armour", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pKn-zkB2L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pKn-zkB2L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pKn-zkB2L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "adidas Men's Racer TR21 Trail Running Shoe, Grey/Black/Sonic Ink, 10", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JN54TGW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "adidas", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NgLPfBY9L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NgLPfBY9L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NgLPfBY9L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "ASICS Women's Gel-Excite 9 Running Shoes, 8, White/Orange POP", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CLMR87L?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "ASICS", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31sXxcFqCCL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31sXxcFqCCL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31sXxcFqCCL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "adidas Women's EQ21 Running Shoe, Dash Grey/Almost Pink/Acid Red, 8.5", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B091ML8CPQ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "adidas", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31iQvImlu1L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31iQvImlu1L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31iQvImlu1L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "adidas Women's Cloudfoam Pure 2.0 Running Shoes, White/White/Grey, 7", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CZ3FVRS?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "adidas", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FOpF3jWML._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FOpF3jWML._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FOpF3jWML._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "ASICS Men's Gel-Venture\u00ae 8 Running Shoe, 13, Black/Directoire Blue", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VS3VC1Z?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "ASICS", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4154g1EDzAL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4154g1EDzAL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4154g1EDzAL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "New Balance Men's Fresh Foam 680 V7 Running Shoe, Grey/Ghost Pepper/Black, 10.5", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWR4FV9?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "New Balance", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419kpcXoVVL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419kpcXoVVL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419kpcXoVVL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "New Balance Women's Fresh Foam Arishi V4 Running Shoe, Sea Salt/Sea Salt, 8", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YGVSHZX?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "New Balance", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31fUXOZvTSL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31fUXOZvTSL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31fUXOZvTSL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Saucony mens Kinvara 13 Running Shoe, Night Lite, 10.5 US", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NQHFZ4M?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Saucony", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41C9JUcoYWL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41C9JUcoYWL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41C9JUcoYWL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "adidas Men's Kaptir 2.0 Running Shoes, 10.5", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CZ272F8?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "adidas", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31VuJ1Lj8EL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31VuJ1Lj8EL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31VuJ1Lj8EL._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [":\n\n## Under Armour Mens Charged Assert 9 Running Shoe Review\n\nAre you a runner looking for a comfortable and durable pair of shoes?
