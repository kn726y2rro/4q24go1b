One of the most important parts of a longboard is the wheels. Choosing the right wheels can make a huge difference in your longboarding experience. In this article, we will discuss how to choose the best longboard wheels.\n## Factors to Consider\nWhen choosing longboard wheels, there are several factors to consider. The most important factors are the size, hardness, and material of the wheels.\n### Size\nThe size of the wheels is determined by the length of the skateboard. The longer the skateboard, the larger the wheels should be. Generally, longboards come in two sizes: standard and wide. Standard longboards have wheels that are around 78mm in diameter, while wide longboards have wheels that are around 82mm in diameter. \n### Hardness\nThe hardness of the wheels determines how fast and smooth they roll. The most common types of wheels are urethane and polyurethane. Urethane wheels are softer and faster, while polyurethane wheels are harder and slower. \n### Material\nThe material of the wheels is also important. Wheels made of wood or bamboo are heavier and slower, while wheels made of plastic or composite are lighter and faster.\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, choosing the best longboard wheels involves considering the size, hardness, and material of the wheels. By considering these factors, you can choose the right wheels for your longboard and improve your longboarding experience.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Two Bare Feet 70mm Super Grip Longboard Skate Wheel Set (Orange with bearings)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076552822?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Two Bare Feet", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XjeZvSzyL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XjeZvSzyL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XjeZvSzyL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Yitre Wheels, Stable Longboard Wheel Quiet 70 Percent Resilience 78A Hardness Fast for Asphalt Road", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BRD54P48?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Yitre", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31WYlnagVlL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31WYlnagVlL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31WYlnagVlL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Bigfoot Longboard Wheels 80A Shr Mountain Cruisers, Black, 76mm", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B077BFPGGD?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Bigfoot", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51A1-oqTypL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51A1-oqTypL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51A1-oqTypL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "RaceBon 60mm Longboard Skateboard Wheels Hardness 78A Polyurethane Cruising Wheel Free 608 Bearings and Spacers Set of 4 (White)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08BXN3R56?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "RaceBon", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DD0xCrSOL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DD0xCrSOL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DD0xCrSOL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Orangatang Moronga 72.5 mm 86a Freeride Longboard Skateboard Wheels (Yellow, Set of 4)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B074XHQ7RS?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Orangatang", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vW0SptCgL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vW0SptCgL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vW0SptCgL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Cloud Ride!
