They are also useful for people who want to cool a specific room or area without wasting energy on the rest of the house. However, choosing the right portable air conditioner can be a daunting task. Here are some tips to help you choose the best portable air conditioner for your needs.\n## Consider the Size of Your Room\nThe first thing to consider when choosing a portable air conditioner is the size of your room. If your room is small, you don't need a large portable air conditioner. In fact, a small portable air conditioner will be more energy-efficient and will save you money on your electricity bill. However, if your room is large, you will need a larger portable air conditioner to cool it down effectively.\n## Look for Energy Efficiency\nEnergy efficiency is another important consideration when choosing a portable air conditioner. Look for a unit that has an Energy Star rating. Energy Star-certified units are designed to be energy-efficient and will save you money on your electricity bill over time.\n## Consider the Noise Level\nNoise level is also an important consideration when choosing a portable air conditioner. Some units are very noisy, while others are relatively quiet. If you are using the portable air conditioner in a bedroom or office, noise level is an important consideration. Look for a unit that has a low noise level to ensure a comfortable and peaceful environment.\n## Check the Warranty\nFinally, check the warranty when choosing a portable air conditioner. A unit with a long warranty will give you peace of mind and ensure that you are covered in case of any problems. Look for a unit that comes with a at least a one-year warranty.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best portable air conditioner depends on your needs and preferences. Consider the size of your room, look for energy efficiency, consider noise level, and check the warranty when choosing a portable air conditioner. By following these tips, you can choose the right portable air conditioner for your needs and enjoy cool air in any room or area in your home or office.", "cool_products": [{"title": "BLACK+DECKER 10,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner up to 450 Sq. ft. with Remote Control, White", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DLPUWG2?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "BLACK+DECKER", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31dg4ITUd5L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31dg4ITUd5L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31dg4ITUd5L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Portable Air Conditioners, 12000 BTU Portable AC Uint with Dehumidifier & Fan Mode for Room up to 550 Sq.Ft, 3-in-1 Room Air Conditioner with Remote, 24Hrs Timer, Installation Kit for Home Office", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C378BMTV?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Dokoworld", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41oigd97f3L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41oigd97f3L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41oigd97f3L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Portable Air Conditioner, 3-IN-Evaporative Air Conditioner in 3 Speed, USB Personal Mini Air Cooler with LED Light for Bedroom, Office, Living Room & More", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9Z77VRB?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Dr.me", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51UrO25U0sL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51UrO25U0sL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51UrO25U0sL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Portable Air Conditioners, 4-IN-1 Evaporative Air Cooler with 3 Winds Speeds & 3 Air Sprayers, Colorful Lights, Rechargeable Air Cooler Fan Quiet Desk Fan Portable AC for Room Office Dorm Car Camping", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZCRG7B9?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "KOFOT", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418QMTZbxKL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418QMTZbxKL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418QMTZbxKL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Honeywell Compact Portable Air Conditioner with Dehumidifier and Fan for Rooms Up To 450 Sq.
