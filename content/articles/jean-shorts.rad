They are perfect for any casual occasion, whether you're running errands, going to the beach, or just hanging out with friends. However, with so many styles and brands available, it can be difficult to know which ones are the best. Here are some tips to help you choose the perfect pair of jean shorts for your body type and style.\n## Consider Your Body Type\nThe first thing to consider when choosing jean shorts is your body type. If you have an hourglass figure, then you may want to choose a pair of high-waisted shorts that will accentuate your waist. On the other hand, if you have a boyish figure, you may want to choose a pair of low-rise shorts that will balance out your body.\n## Consider Your Style\nAnother important factor to consider when choosing jean shorts is your personal style. If you want a casual, relaxed look, then you may want to choose a pair of distressed shorts that can be dressed up or down. If you prefer a more polished look, then you may want to choose a pair of classic denim shorts that can be paired with a blouse or cropped top.\n## Choose the Right Fit\nThe most important factor when choosing jean shorts is finding the right fit. Shorts that are too tight or too loose can look unflattering and uncomfortable. When trying on shorts, make sure that they are snug around the waist and hips, but not so tight that they are uncomfortable. Additionally, make sure that the length of the shorts is appropriate for your body type.\n## Look for Quality Materials\nAnother important factor to consider when choosing jean shorts is the quality of the materials used. Look for shorts made from high-quality denim or other durable materials that will last for years. Additionally, look for shorts that have been well-constructed and have durable stitching and zippers.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best jean shorts is all about finding the right fit, style, and quality. By considering your body type, personal style, and material quality, you can find a pair of jean shorts that will complement your wardrobe and flatter your figure.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Crosshatch Mens Newberg or Gaston Denim Shorts - Newburg - Mid Wash - 34\"", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07NRWVD6Q?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Crosshatch", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vclMxX0wL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vclMxX0wL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vclMxX0wL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Threadbare Mens Denim Shorts Casual Designer Knee Length Jean Shorts", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C4QCW7YZ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Threadbare", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DgSLtmBCL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DgSLtmBCL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DgSLtmBCL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "NOROZE Women's Ladies Knee Length Denim Stretchy Bermuda Shorts Contrast Turn Up Cropped Jean Shorts Denim Capri Rolled-Up Hem Casual Summer Classic Cotton Pants with Pockets (Mid Blue E427, XL)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B094Q73BPB?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "NOROZE", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Klb+BgQZS._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Klb+BgQZS._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Klb+BgQZS._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Mens Stretch Roll Up Ripped Denim Shorts Classic Slim Fit Cotton Washes Vintage Summer Casual Skinny Jeans Black", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BWJLKT9B?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Generic", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41o9ulLTx1L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41o9ulLTx1L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41o9ulLTx1L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Crosshatch Mens Stretch Denim Shorts Belted Knee Length Roll Up Faded Casual New, Dark Wash, 34W", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B096QWKLDR?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Crosshatch", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41X0iEpQW0S._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41X0iEpQW0S._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41X0iEpQW0S._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Duck and Cover - Mens Everyday Essential Cotton 'MUSTONE' Slim Fit Casual Summer Denim Shorts (W36, Dark Wash)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B4PJ5K64?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Duck and Cover", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CJ9fRPxoL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CJ9fRPxoL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CJ9fRPxoL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Enzo Jeans Mens Shorts Raw Combat Cargo Pockets Casual Knee Length Denim Pants (34W, Light Blue)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08B6DQBW7?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Ze ENZO", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41APKNSZBXL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41APKNSZBXL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41APKNSZBXL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Wrangler Authentics Men's Comfort Denim Short, Flex Dark, 42", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HNVJCVS?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Wrangler Authentics", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41IHUAQoiIL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41IHUAQoiIL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41IHUAQoiIL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Levi's Men's 405 Standard Shorts Denim Shorts, Black Rinse Adv Short, 36W", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0897YR8LS?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Levi's", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41u0yPdvlOL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41u0yPdvlOL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41u0yPdvlOL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Levi's Men's 501 Original Shorts Big & Tall Denim Shorts, Bleu Eyes Break Short, 44", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B29J557Q?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Levi's", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41cX6TQEU7L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41cX6TQEU7L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41cX6TQEU7L._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [":\nCrosshatch Mens Newberg or Gaston Denim Shorts - Newburg - Mid Wash - 34\"\n\nThese Crosshatch Mens Newberg or Gaston Denim Shorts are a must-have for any man who wants to upgrade his casual wardrobe.
