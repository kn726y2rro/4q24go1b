These lures are known for their ability to mimic the movements of a baitfish or insect, enticing fish to strike. Choosing the right topwater lure can make all the difference in your fishing success. Here are some tips to help you choose the best lures for topwater fishing:\n## Types of Topwater Lures\nThere are several types of topwater lures to choose from, each designed for different fishing situations. Here are some of the most popular types of topwater lures:\n- **Hard Lures**: These lures are made of plastic and are designed to sink to the bottom. They are ideal for fishing in deeper water or when the fish are not very active.\n- **Soft Lures**: These lures are made of soft plastic and are designed to float on the surface. They are ideal for fishing in shallow water or when the fish are actively feeding on the surface.\n- **Spinnerbaits**: These lures are designed to spin on the surface, creating a flashy, enticing profile that attracts fish. They are ideal for fishing in shallow water or when the fish are active and feeding aggressively.\n## Considerations for Choosing Topwater Lures\nWhen choosing topwater lures, there are several factors to consider:\n- **Size**: Choose a lure that is the right size for the fish you are targeting. Larger fish may require larger lures, while smaller fish may require smaller lures.\n- **Color**: Choose a lure that matches the color of the baitfish or insects in the area you are fishing. This will help you to blend in with the surroundings and attract the fish.\n- **Action**: Choose a lure with a natural action that imitates the movements of a baitfish or insect. This will help you to attract the fish without giving them a hint that you are there.\n## Conclusion\nTopwater fishing with lures is a fun and exciting way to catch fish. By choosing the right topwater lure, you can increase your chances of success and have a great time out on the water. Whether you are a beginner fisherman or an experienced pro, topwater fishing can provide some of the most exciting fishing experiences of your life.", "cool_products": [{"title": "GOANDO Fishing Lures Kit for Freshwater Bait Tackle Kit for Bass Trout Salmon Fishing Accessories Tackle Box Including Spoon Lures Soft Plastic Worms Crankbait Jigs Fishing Hooks", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DY9NGQV?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "GOANDO", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CeM7cRa1S._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CeM7cRa1S._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CeM7cRa1S._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "275pcs Fishing Lure Set Including Frog Lures Soft Fishing Lure Hard Metal Lure VIB Rattle Crank Popper Minnow Pencil Metal Jig Hook for Trout Bass Salmon with Free Tackle Box", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EV1TPYU?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "PWWDADA", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+dEwq4n2L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+dEwq4n2L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+dEwq4n2L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "PLUSINNO Fishing Lures Baits Tackle Including Crankbaits, Spinnerbaits, Plastic Worms, Jigs, Topwater Lures, Tackle Box and More Fishing Gear Lures Kit Set, 102/302Pcs Fishing Lure Tackle", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GSDK5YS?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "PLUSINNO", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rypr+rogL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rypr+rogL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rypr+rogL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "LASOCUHOO Fishing Lures Kit, (94Pcs) Spoon Lures, Soft Plastic Worms, Frog Lures, Bait Tackle Kit for Bass, Trout, Salmon for Freshwater and Saltwater", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BWT4MB4?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "LASOCUHOO", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XpJrvMoJL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XpJrvMoJL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XpJrvMoJL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Lunkerhunt -
