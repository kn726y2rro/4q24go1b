One type of lure that is becoming increasingly popular is the topwater lure. These lures are designed to attract fish that are active during the day, such as bass and trout. In this article, we will discuss how to choose the best topwater lures for your fishing trip.\nTopwater lures are designed to be fished near the surface of the water. They are typically made of plastic and are available in a variety of shapes and colors. Some of the most popular topwater lures include soft plastic worms, poppers, and jerkbaits.\n### Soft Plastic Worms\nSoft plastic worms are one of the most popular topwater lures. They are easy to fish with and can be fished using a variety of techniques. Soft plastic worms are available in a variety of colors and sizes, and they can be rigged with a weight to help them sink to the bottom.\n### Poppers\nPoppers are another popular topwater lure. They are designed to resemble a baitfish, and they are often used to catch bass. Poppers should be fished slowly near the surface of the water to attract fish.\n### Jerkbaits\nJerkbaits are another type of topwater lure that is becoming increasingly popular. They are designed to be fished with a jerking motion, and they are often used to catch large fish such as bass and pike.\n### Choosing the Right Lure\nWhen choosing a topwater lure, it is important to consider the type of fish you are trying to catch. Different lures are effective for different types of fish. For example, soft plastic worms are effective for catching bass, while poppers are effective for catching trout.\nIn addition to the type of fish you are trying to catch, you should also consider the weather conditions. Topwater lures are most effective when the water is calm and there is no wind. If the water is too rough, it may be better to use a different type of lure.\n### Conclusion\nTopwater lures are a great way to catch a variety of fish, including bass, trout, and pike. When choosing a topwater lure, it is important to consider the type of fish you are trying to catch and the weather conditions.
