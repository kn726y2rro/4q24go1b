It's important to consider several factors when selecting an axe, including its weight, head size, handle material, and durability. In this guide, we'll go over some of the key features to look for when choosing the best axe.\n## Weight And Head Size\nThe first thing to consider when choosing an axe is its weight and head size. Heavier axes tend to be more durable and can handle tougher jobs, while lighter axes are easier to swing and control. When it comes to head size, larger heads provide more power and can cut through thicker materials, but they may also be heavier and harder to swing. Consider your specific needs before deciding on a head size.\n## Handle Material\nAnother important factor to consider is the handle material. Wooden handles are typically more durable and comfortable to grip than metal ones, although metal handles can be more lightweight. Additionally, wooden handles can swell if they get wet, which can affect their strength. Metal handles are generally more resistant to damage and can be easily replaced if needed.\n## Durability\nFinally, durability is crucial when choosing an axe. Look for an axe made from high-quality materials like forged steel or stainless steel. These materials are more resistant to wear and tear and can last longer than cheaper models made from weaker materials. Also, check that the axe head is securely fastened to the handle \u2013 a loose head can be dangerous and reduce the axe's effectiveness.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best axe requires careful consideration of several factors, including weight, head size, handle material, and durability. By taking these factors into account, you can select an axe that meets your specific needs and provides years of reliable service.", "cool_products": [{"title": "TOPWAY 331212 Wood Splitter Axe with Fiber Handle 1.1/4LB, Yellow", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07N6P96RF?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "TOPWAY", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31veiBk-MjL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31veiBk-MjL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31veiBk-MjL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Roughneck ROU65670 Vintage Hand Axe,Brown,0.6kg/1\u00bclbs,", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B075Z33T3S?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Roughneck", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31yZl9r0tGL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31yZl9r0tGL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31yZl9r0tGL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Rolson 12108 20oz One Piece Splitting Hand Axe Hatchet Splitter Outdoor Camping Professional,Yellow/ Black", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B5V3S9KZ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Rolson", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31PoqDcufhL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31PoqDcufhL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31PoqDcufhL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Rolson 12100 Stubby Camping Axe, Black, 28 x 130 x 250 millimetres", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004YAWASM?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Rolson", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31wIDvPAubL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31wIDvPAubL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31wIDvPAubL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Spear & Jackson - Razorsharp 4.5lb Axe Hickory Shaft Carbon Steel Head", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B002W5VM94?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Spear & Jackson", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21oScnFE3UL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21oScnFE3UL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21oScnFE3UL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Convy Multi Functional Axe, 600 g, Red, convy-GJ89EU", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08XXNCMT3?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Convy", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XjDbP2aZS._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XjDbP2aZS._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XjDbP2aZS._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Fiskars Chopping Axe XS X7, Includes Storage and Carrying Case, Length: 35.5 cm, Non-Stick Coating, High Steel Blade/Fibreglass Handle, Black/Orange, 1015618", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00YKUG032?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Fiskars", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31MC7Fvf3yL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31MC7Fvf3yL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31MC7Fvf3yL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Unibos | Hand Axe Fibreglass Shaft | 4lb Lightweight | Solid Steel Head | Ergonomic Shock Absorbing | Long Handle | Log Splitting Maul | Camping Axe | Axe for Firewood | \ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde9\ud835\uddec \ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddec", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09WRVP5VP?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Unibos", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pT38-s3uL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pT38-s3uL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pT38-s3uL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Faithfull FAIAXE114 Hickory Shaft Hatchet Axe 1.1/4lb", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0001IWPD6?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Faithfull", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/310nv5kEwKL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/310nv5kEwKL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/310nv5kEwKL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Roughneck ROU11070 Gorilla V-Series Axe 0.6kg/1\u00bclbs", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09RGHSDPW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Roughneck", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31cExbrVrFL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31cExbrVrFL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31cExbrVrFL._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [": \n## Review: TOPWAY 331212 Wood Splitter Axe with Fiber Handle 1.1/4LB, Yellow\nIf you're looking for a high-quality wood splitter axe that is durable, rust-resistant, and ideal for chopping wood, then look no further than TOPWAY's 331212 model.
