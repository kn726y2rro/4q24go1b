They add depth and complexity to the sound of the drums, and they are also used for accents and rhythmic variations. Choosing the right cymbals can be a daunting task, especially for beginners who may not have a lot of experience with musical instruments. However, by following a few simple guidelines, you can find the perfect cymbals for your playing style and budget.\nThe first thing to consider when choosing cymbals is their size and weight. Cymbals come in a range of sizes, from small cocktail cymbals to large ride cymbals. The weight of the cymbals is also important, as heavier cymbals tend to have a deeper, richer sound than lighter ones. For beginners, it's a good idea to start with medium-sized cymbals that are not too heavy. This will allow you to get used to the feel of the cymbals without overwhelming your drum set.\nAnother important factor to consider when choosing cymbals is their finish. Cymbals can be finished in a variety of ways, including brass, bronze, and silver. The finish of the cymbals will affect their tone, with brass and bronze finishes tending to be warmer and more mellow, and silver finishes producing a brighter, more resonant sound. Beginners may want to start with a silver-finished cymbal, which will provide a good balance of brightness and warmth.\nFinally, it's important to consider the size and shape of the cymbal when choosing them. Cymbals come in a range of sizes and shapes, including crash, ride, hi-hat, and choke cymbals. Each type of cymbal has its own unique sound and purpose, so it's important to choose the right one for your playing style. For beginners, it's a good idea to stick with basic crash and ride cymbals, which are versatile enough to cover a wide range of musical styles.\nIn conclusion, choosing the right cymbals for your drum set is an important part of building a successful musical setup. By considering the size, weight, finish, and shape of the cymbals, you can find the perfect pair to complement your drum set and enhance your playing style.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Andoer 15cm/5.9in Mini Small Kids Children Copper Hand Cymbals Gong Band Rhythm Beats Percussion Musical Instrument Finger Cymbals", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEJAPMQ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "an-do-er", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41m6XZVqOSL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41m6XZVqOSL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41m6XZVqOSL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "EXCEART Hi Hat Cymbals Crash/Ride Cymbal Brass Sturdy Hi-hat Cymbal for Drum Players Percussion Drum, 8 Inches", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M5KY6NF?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "EXCEART", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ml6kVH-bL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ml6kVH-bL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ml6kVH-bL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Zildjian Planet Z Complete Cymbal Set -
