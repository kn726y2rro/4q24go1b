Whether you are looking for an upright vacuum, a cylinder vacuum, or a stick vacuum, there are several factors to consider before making a purchase.\n## Types of Vacuums\nThe first thing to consider when choosing a vacuum cleaner is the type of vacuum you need. There are three main types of vacuums: upright, cylinder, and stick.\n### Upright Vacuums\nUpright vacuums are the most popular type of vacuum cleaner. They are versatile and can be used on a variety of surfaces, including carpet, hardwood floors, and tile. Upright vacuums come in various sizes and can be either bagged or bagless.\n### Cylinder Vacuums\nCylinder vacuums are ideal for those with allergies or asthma. They work like an upright vacuum, but the dirt container is located at the front of the vacuum instead of the back. This makes it easier to dispose of the dirt without having to touch it.\n### Stick Vacuums\nStick vacuums are lightweight and easy to store. They are ideal for those who have limited space or who need to clean hard-to-reach areas, such as stairs or corners. Stick vacuums come with a variety of attachments, including crevice tools and dusting brushes.\n## Features to Consider\nOnce you have decided on the type of vacuum cleaner you need, you should consider the features that are important to you. Some features to consider include:\n### Suction Power\nSuction power is important because it determines how well the vacuum will clean your floor. Look for a vacuum with at least 500 watts of suction power.\n### Filters\nFilters are important because they help to remove dust and allergens from the air. Look for a vacuum with a HEPA filter, which is the highest quality filter.\n### Weight\nIf you plan to carry the vacuum up and down stairs, look for a lightweight model. Otherwise, a heavier vacuum will be more stable and easier to maneuver.\n### Cord Length\nCord length is important if you plan to clean large areas or if you need to reach outlets that are located far away. Look for a vacuum with a long cord that is at least 25 feet long.\n## Brands to Consider\nThere are many brands of vacuum cleaners on the market, so it's important to do your research before making a purchase. Some popular brands include Dyson, Shark, and Hoover.\nIn conclusion, choosing the right vacuum cleaner can be a daunting task, but by considering the type of vacuum, features, and brands, you can make an informed decision that fits your needs and budget.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Russell Hobbs RHCV3601 ATLAS2 PET 2.5L Cylinder Vacuum, Grey & Purple, 700 W, 2.5 liters, 77.5 Decibeles", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0883SL2G4?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Russell Hobbs", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41upv7mooYL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41upv7mooYL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41upv7mooYL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Akitas V8 22.2v 150w 3in1 Cordless Upright Handheld Stick Vacuum Cleaner Hoover Lightweight Rechargeable Lithium Battery", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09152HXCG?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Akitas", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41h6rhuVZWL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41h6rhuVZWL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41h6rhuVZWL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Vax Mach Air Upright Vacuum Cleaner | Powerful, Multi-cyclonic, with No Loss of Suction | Lightweight -
