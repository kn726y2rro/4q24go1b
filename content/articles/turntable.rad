However, to truly enjoy the experience, you need a turntable that can do justice to your vinyl collection. Choosing the right turntable can be a daunting task, but with a little knowledge and research, you can find the perfect one for your needs. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the best turntable.\n## Size and Weight\nThe size and weight of a turntable can affect how easy it is to transport and set up. If you plan to take your turntable with you on trips or move frequently, you'll want something lightweight and compact. However, if you plan to set up your turntable in one place and leave it there, a larger and heavier turntable may be more stable and provide better sound quality.\n## Platter Size\nThe platter size is another important factor to consider. A larger platter can provide better sound quality and reduce the wear and tear on your records. However, a larger platter can also be more difficult to move and may require more space.\n## Motor Type\nThe type of motor used in a turntable can also affect its sound quality. Some turntables use belt-drive motors, which can provide quieter operation and lower friction. Others use direct-drive motors, which can be more affordable but may produce more noise.\n## Features\nFinally, consider the features offered by different turntables. Some turntables come with built-in phonograph cartridges, which can save you money and make set up easier. Others offer Bluetooth connectivity or other modern features.\nBy considering these factors, you can find the best turntable for your needs and start enjoying your vinyl collection like never before.", "cool_products": [{"title": "1 BY ONE Bluetooth Record Player Belt-Drive 3-Speed Portable Vinyl Turntable with Built in Speakers, Supports RCA Output, Headphone Jack, MP3, Mobile Phones Music Playback, Turquoise", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00XVJLYPW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "1 BY ONE", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41p6DK-zunL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41p6DK-zunL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41p6DK-zunL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Sony PS-LX310BT Bluetooth Turntable with built-in Phono Pre-Amp, 2 speeds and 3 gain modes, Black", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MNLRP63?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Sony", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31g6lUdH5SL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31g6lUdH5SL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31g6lUdH5SL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Mersoco Bluetooth Record Player Belt-Driven 3-Speed Turntable, Vintage Vinyl Record Players Built-in Stereo Speakers, with Headphone Jack/Aux Input/RCA Line Out, Wooden", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07RYRT148?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Mersoco", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Z414o9IVL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Z414o9IVL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Z414o9IVL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "1 BY ONE Bluetooth Turntable Hi-Fi System with 36 Watt Bookshelf Speakers, Vinyl Record Player with Magnetic Cartridge", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07H918TNW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "1 BY ONE", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31e2ELBTz7S._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31e2ELBTz7S._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31e2ELBTz7S._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Audio-Technica AT-LP120XUSB Manual Direct-Drive Turntable (Analogue & USB)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MVY92KZ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Audio-Technica", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41TigERUGcL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41TigERUGcL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41TigERUGcL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Audio-Technica AT-LP60XBT Full Automatic Wireless Belt-Drive Turntable", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MVYJF38?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Audio-Technica", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41SmGB0l3LL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41SmGB0l3LL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41SmGB0l3LL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "House of Marley Stir It Up Record Player (non-Bluetooth) \u2013 Vinyl Turntable, Stereo Pre-Amp, USB Port, Record LP to PC, 33 + 45 RPM, Anti-Skating, RCA Audio Out to 3.5mm Cable, Bamboo/Black", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01JT42M8U?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "House of Marley", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412AE3Dn4WL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412AE3Dn4WL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412AE3Dn4WL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "ION Audio Max LP -
