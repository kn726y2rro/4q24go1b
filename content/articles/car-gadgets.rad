phone holder, Automatic Clamping, Air Vent mount, Car Gadget, Car accessories, Compatible with iPhone 13 Pro, 12 Max Mini/11/XS/XR Samsung S20/S10 note 20 -Black\n## What I Like\nThe 0011 15W Fast Wireless Car Charger is an excellent car accessory for anyone who wants a convenient and safe way to charge their phone while on the go. \nFirst and foremost, I love the automatic clamping feature of this wireless car charger. It makes it very easy to place your phone on the mount, and the holder will automatically clamp the phone in place.

The built-in protection against over-charging, over-temperature, and over-current ensures that your phone is always safe while charging. \n## What I Don't Like\nWhile I like the automatic clamping feature, I think it could be improved. The holder sometimes struggles to clamp the phone securely, especially if the phone has a thick case.

While it's not too expensive, it's still more expensive than some other wireless car chargers on the market. \n## Overall Rating\nDespite the few drawbacks, I would still recommend the 0011 15W Fast Wireless Car Charger.
