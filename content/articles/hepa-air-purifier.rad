One type of air purifier that has gained popularity is the HEPA air purifier. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the best HEPA air purifier for your needs.\n## Types of HEPA Air Purifiers\nThere are two types of HEPA air purifiers: portable and whole-house. Portable HEPA air purifiers are smaller and more affordable, but they can only clean the air in a single room. Whole-house HEPA air purifiers, on the other hand, are larger and more expensive, but they can clean the air throughout your entire home.\n## Air Purification Capacity\nThe air purification capacity of a HEPA air purifier is measured in microns. The smaller the micron rating, the more efficient the air purifier is at trapping dust and allergens. Look for a HEPA air purifier with a micron rating of at least 100, as this is considered to be very effective in removing pollutants from the air.\n## Noise Level\nHEPA air purifiers can be quite noisy, so it's important to consider the noise level when choosing one. Look for a HEPA air purifier with a noise level of less than 60 decibels, as this is considered to be quiet and not disruptive to your daily routine.\n## Size and Weight\nPortable HEPA air purifiers are lightweight and easy to move around, but they may be smaller than whole-house HEPA air purifiers. Consider the size of your home and how much space you have available before deciding which type of HEPA air purifier is right for you.\n## Warranty and Customer Reviews\nLook for a HEPA air purifier with a good warranty and positive customer reviews. This will give you peace of mind and ensure that you are getting a high-quality product.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best HEPA air purifier for your needs depends on various factors such as air purification capacity, noise level, size, and warranty. By considering these factors, you can make an informed decision and improve the air quality in your home.", "cool_products": [{"title": "CONOPU Air Purifier for Home Bedroom with Hepa H13 99.97% Filter, Air Cleaner portable for Allergies, Dust, Odors, Pet, Pollen", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BCW2KBWV?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "CONOPU", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gsgKMap8L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gsgKMap8L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gsgKMap8L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "LEVOIT Air Purifier for Home Bedroom, Ultra Quiet HEPA Air Filter Cleaner with Fragrance Sponge & 3 Speed for Better Sleep, Allergies, Dust, Odour, Pet, Smoke, Office, Desktop, 100% Ozone Free", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09GTRVJQM?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Levoit", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nAvNnqMvL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nAvNnqMvL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nAvNnqMvL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "LEVOIT Air Purifier for Home Bedroom, Dual H13 HEPA Filters with Aromatherapy Diffuser, Quiet Sleep Mode, Air Cleaner for Smoke, Allergies, Pet Dander, 100% Ozone Free, LV-H128", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08BR1CR78?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Levoit", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513CAzEbedL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513CAzEbedL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513CAzEbedL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Silentnight Air Purifier with HEPA & Carbon Filters, Air Cleaner for Allergies, Pollen, Pets, Dust, Smokers;
