A quality chicken coop will provide your chickens with a safe and comfortable living space, as well as protect them from predators. However, choosing the right chicken coop can be overwhelming, especially if you're new to keeping chickens. In this article, we'll go over some key factors to consider when selecting the perfect chicken coop for your flock.\n## Size Matters\nThe first thing to consider when choosing a chicken coop is its size. You want to make sure that your chickens have enough room to move around comfortably without feeling cramped. A good rule of thumb is to allow at least 4 square feet per chicken. So, if you have 10 chickens, you should aim to have a coop that's at least 40 square feet in size. It's important to keep in mind that your chickens will need additional space during the winter months when they require extra heat.\nAnother factor to consider is the height of the coop. Chickens require a higher perch to roost (sleep) at night, so make sure that your coop has a raised area where they can easily access. This will prevent injuries caused by climbing up and down from lower levels.\n## Material Matters\nChicken coops come in various materials such as wood, plastic, metal, and even concrete. Each material has its pros and cons, so it's important to weigh them before making a decision. Wooden coops are popular because they look great and blend seamlessly into most backyards. They're also easy to clean and maintain. Plastic coops, on the other hand, are lightweight and low maintenance. Metal coops are durable and resistant to weather conditions like rain and snow. Concrete coops offer the lowest maintenance and are ideal for areas with extreme temperatures.\n## Accessibility\nAccessibility is another crucial factor to consider while choosing a chicken coop. Your chickens will need to enter and exit the coop frequently throughout the day. Make sure that there are no obstacles blocking the entrance and that the door is large enough for your chickens to easily fit through. Additionally, ensure that the roof of the coop provides adequate ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and promote air circulation.\nIn conclusion, choosing the best chicken coop depends on several factors including size, material, accessibility, and maintenance requirements. By considering these key factors, you can select a chicken coop that meets all of your needs and ensures the health and happiness of your flock. Happy cooping!", "cool_products": [{"title": "VOUNOT Chicken Coop and Run, Wooden Hen House with Nest Box, Poultry Ark Coup Rabbit Hutch Home", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0872VHKBC?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "VOUNOT", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41tfcW1yExL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41tfcW1yExL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41tfcW1yExL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Pets Imperial\u00ae Dorchester Chicken Coop - Ark Poultry Nest Box - Chickn House with Sliding Tray & Opening Roof - Integrated Chicken Run", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076JCFH9Y?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Pets Imperial", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3c8LBWzL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3c8LBWzL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3c8LBWzL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Large XXL Eggshell Buckingham 8ft 100% Fox Proof 3mm Welded & Coated Wire Chicken Coop Hen House Ark Poultry Run Nest Box Rabbit Hutch 2 to 4 birds NOW WITH FULLY COVERED ALL YEAR-ROUND RUN", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00B18MDL4?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Eggshell", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51p7I3q3GRL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51p7I3q3GRL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51p7I3q3GRL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "FeelGoodUK Windsor Chicken Coop and Run Medium Hen House Poultry Ark Nest Box & Slide Out Tray 175cm Width 66cm Depth 100cm Height", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00MGM3CY6?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "feel good", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N9c2AB0mL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N9c2AB0mL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N9c2AB0mL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "FeelGoodUK Hen House Large Chicken Coop Poultry Ark Nesting Box & Slide Out Cleaning Tray 115cm Width * 85cm Depth * 90cm Height", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004AUW8JC?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "feel good", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616R1DZEN8L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616R1DZEN8L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616R1DZEN8L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "COCOON CHICKEN COOP HEN HOUSE POULTRY ARK NEST BOX NEW - WITH 4 NEST BOXES & CLEANING TRAY - 4 STANDARD OR 6 SMALL BIRDS", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B006I8YCLQ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Cocoon", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ta3CPBPVL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ta3CPBPVL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ta3CPBPVL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "PawHut Chicken Coop with Run Wooden Hen House Pet Poultry Coops Cages Small Animal Outdoor Pen with Nesting Box 166 x 124 x 112cm", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08ZD6QR4Z?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "PawHut", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41SD7GtlxFL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41SD7GtlxFL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41SD7GtlxFL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "PawHut Chicken Coop with Run Hen House Poultry Coops Cages Pen Outdoor Backyard with Nesting Box 196 x 76 x 97cm Natural", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08Y98S7Y7?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "PawHut", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41QwwiGsAhL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41QwwiGsAhL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41QwwiGsAhL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Pets Imperial\u00ae Warwick Chicken Coop with Integrated Run Area - 175 cm (W) x 66 cm (D) x 100 cm (H) - Asphalt Roof (Golden)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07QCP1G35?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Pets Imperial", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sMswhsqrL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sMswhsqrL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sMswhsqrL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Pets Imperial\u00ae Hawksmoor Chicken Coop - 2 Nesting Spaces - Wooden Chicken House - Sliding Tray & Opening Roof (Grey)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B095CNQLKN?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Pets Imperial", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yafmbSc0S._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yafmbSc0S._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yafmbSc0S._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [": \n# VOUNOT Chicken Coop and Run Review\nIf you're looking for a high quality chicken coop that is both functional and stylish, then look no further than the VOUNOT Chicken Coop and Run.
