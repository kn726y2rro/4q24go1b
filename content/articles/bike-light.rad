One of the most important pieces of equipment for biking at night is a good bike light. There are many different types of bike lights available on the market today, so it can be difficult to know which one is the best for your needs. In this article, we'll go over some of the key features to look for when choosing the best bike light.\n## Types Of Lights\nThere are two main types of bike lights - front lights and rear lights. Front lights are usually mounted on the handlebars and shine forward, while rear lights are mounted on the back of the bike and shine backward. Both types of lights are useful for different situations. For example, a front light is better for riding on roads with no shoulder or where there are cars parked on the side of the road. A rear light is better for riding on trails where there may be obstacles in your path.\n## Lumens And Runtime\nThe lumen rating of a bike light measures how much light it emits. The higher the lumen rating, the brighter the light. Most bike lights come with a runtime, which tells you how long they can run on a single set of batteries. Look for a light with a high lumen rating and a long runtime. This will ensure that you have enough light for your ride.\n## Mounting Options\nSome bike lights come with mounting options such as straps or magnets. These options make it easier to attach the light to your bike without having to use screws or other tools. Additionally, these options allow you to easily remove the light if you need to take it off for storage or transportation.\n## Water Resistance\nIf you plan on riding your bike in wet conditions such as rain or snow, look for a bike light that is water resistant. This will protect the light from moisture damage and prolong its lifespan.\nIn conclusion, when choosing the best bike light, consider the type of lighting needed, the lumen and runtime ratings, mounting options, and water resistance. With these factors in mind, you'll be able to find a bike light that meets all of your needs and keeps you safe while riding at night.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Balhvit Bike Light Set, Super Bright USB Rechargeable Bicycle Lights, Waterproof Mountain Road Bike Lights Rechargeable, Safety & Easy Mount LED Cycle Lights, USB Cycling Front Light & Rear Light", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B077RXY17S?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Balhvit", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YaU+L8-vL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YaU+L8-vL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YaU+L8-vL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Bike Light Set | SEE & BE SEEN | Super-Bright!
