These toys are perfect for kids and adults alike, and they provide hours of entertainment. However, with so many different types of gel blasters on the market, it can be difficult to choose the right one for your needs. In this article, we will discuss some of the key factors to consider when selecting a gel blaster.\n## Types of Gel Blasters\nThere are two main types of gel blasters: water pistols and foam blasters. Water pistols use water to fire projectiles, while foam blasters use foam darts or bullets. Both types of blasters are popular and offer a different level of play. Water pistols are great for playing in the pool or the backyard, while foam blasters are perfect for playing in the park or at the beach.\n## Ammunition\nWhen choosing a gel blaster, it's important to consider the ammunition that comes with the toy. Gel blasters use different types of ammunition, including darts, bullets, and foam balls. Darts are small and lightweight, making them perfect for shooting at a distance. Bullets are larger and heavier, making them better for close-range combat. Foam balls are also available, and they are great for targeting practice.\n## Brand\nWhen choosing a gel blaster, it's important to consider the brand. Some brands are known for their high-quality products, while others are known for their affordability. Some popular brands of gel blasters include Nerf, Buzz Bee, and Hasbro. Each brand offers a different level of play, and some are better suited for certain types of players.\n## Price\nFinally, it's important to consider the price of the gel blaster. Some models are expensive, while others are more affordable. However, it's important to remember that a more expensive gel blaster doesn't necessarily mean a better product. Some more affordable gel blasters offer great value for their price.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, when choosing a gel blaster, it's important to consider the type of blaster, the ammunition, the brand, and the price. By taking these factors into account, you can choose a gel blaster that is just right for your needs. Whether you're looking for a water pistol, a foam blaster, or something in between, there is a gel blaster out there for you.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Gel Blasters Guns - Gel Ball Guns - Cool Splatter Ball Guns With 10000pcs Gel Blasters Bullets | New AKM-47 Electric Gel Blasters Guns Toy For Adults And Kids 14+ Outdoor Activity", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C9CK8XHX?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Geteawily", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iufvv7JvL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iufvv7JvL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iufvv7JvL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Gel Ball Toy, Electric Gel Ball Blasters With Goggles 50000 Balls For Outdoor Sports And Team Fighting Games, Suitable For Teens 15+ (Blue)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BPY1RFGC?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "HYNXM", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510BEVJBhXL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510BEVJBhXL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510BEVJBhXL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Gel Blaster, AKM-47 Automatic Electric Toy Foam Blasters For Kids With 10 Recycle Soft Bullets & 10000 Bullets, Gel Blasters Pistol For Children & Adults Outdoor (Blue)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BNHWM2FB?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Avyvi", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DkNkr49HL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DkNkr49HL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DkNkr49HL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "JOJOJOSDA Electric Gel Ball Blaster Toy Automatic Splatter Ball Blaster,with 50000+ Bullet And Goggles,for Outdoor Activities -
