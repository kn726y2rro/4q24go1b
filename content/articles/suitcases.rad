Choosing the right suitcases can make all the difference in making your trip as smooth as possible. In this guide, we'll go over some key factors to consider when selecting the perfect suitcases for your next adventure.\n## Size and Weight\nThe first thing to consider is the size and weight of your suitcase. If you're planning on traveling for a long period of time, you want to make sure you select a suitcase that won't put too much strain on your arms or back. A good rule of thumb is to choose a suitcase that's no larger than 22 inches (55 cm) in width and weighs no more than 50 pounds (23 kg). This will ensure that you can easily handle your luggage at the airport and on the train/bus/plane.\nIf you plan on packing light, you may not need a large suitcase. Consider a smaller carry-on sized suitcase that will fit under the seat in front of you on the plane. This will save you money on checked bag fees and ensure that you have access to your belongings during your trip.\nAnother important factor to consider is the weight capacity of your suitcase. Make sure you choose one that can hold all of your belongings without exceeding the weight limit. Most airlines have strict weight limits for checked bags, so it's important to choose a suitcase that won't exceed those limits.\n## Durability\nDurability is another important consideration. You want to make sure your suitcase is made with high-quality materials that can withstand wear and tear. Look for suitcases made with durable fabrics like polyester or nylon, and opt for models with reinforced corners and handles. Some suitcases even come with built-in locks to keep your belongings secure while you travel.\nIn addition to durability, consider the overall design of the suitcase. A sleek and modern design can look great on the carousel at the airport, while a traditional style may be more practical if you plan on using it frequently.\n## Features\nFinally, think about the features that matter most to you. Some popular features include expandable compartments, which can increase the amount of space inside your suitcase; built-in scales to help you keep track of your baggage weight; and adjustable handles that can accommodate different heights.\nBy considering these factors, you should be able to find the perfect suitcases for your travel needs. Remember to choose a model that fits your budget and meets your specific requirements. With the right suitcase, you can focus on enjoying your trip instead of worrying about your luggage.", "cool_products": [{"title": "American Tourister Bon Air Spinner Suitcase 75 cm, 91 L, Black", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00K6VR09W?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "American Tourister", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rHkS1jHSL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rHkS1jHSL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rHkS1jHSL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Aerolite Large Lightweight ABS Hard Shell Travel Hold Check in Luggage Spinner Suitcase with 4 Wheels, 29\"", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B019IGCFW2?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Aerolite", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Yye5WgI8L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Yye5WgI8L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Yye5WgI8L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Tripp Ice Blue World Large 4 Wheel Suitcase", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07D3C2S3X?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "TRIPP", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31vaAlwrljL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31vaAlwrljL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31vaAlwrljL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Large Lightweight ABS Hard Shell Travel Hold Check in Luggage Spinner Suitcase with 4 Wheels (Black)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BFBCXPSQ?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "RMW", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EGiD1oOwL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EGiD1oOwL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EGiD1oOwL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Flight Knight Lightweight 4 Wheel ABS Hard Case Suitcases Cabin & Hold Luggage Options Approved For Over 100 Airlines Including easyJet, British Airways, RyanAir, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates & Many More", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09Q27TTW6?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Flight Knight", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/311Qwykx9XL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/311Qwykx9XL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/311Qwykx9XL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "FLYMAX 32\" Extra Large Suitcase Lightweight Luggage Expandable Hold Check in Travel Bag on Wheels", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076NYR22H?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "FLYMAX", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31vUlX16EQL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31vUlX16EQL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31vUlX16EQL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "CMY Lightweight 4 Wheel ABS Hard Shell Travel Trolley Luggage Suitcase Set, Medium 24\" Hold Check in Luggage (Rose Gold)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09V8C5XPR?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "CMY", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ne5UxlkYL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ne5UxlkYL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ne5UxlkYL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Kono Fashion Hand Luggage Lightweight ABS Hard Shell Trolley Travel Suitcase with 4 Wheels Cabin Carry-on Suitcases (20\", Nude)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07GQV4P4G?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Kono", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ugLG7zq+L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ugLG7zq+L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ugLG7zq+L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Kono Luggage Sets of 2 Piece Lightweight Polypropylene Hard Shell Suitcase with TSA Lock Spinner Wheels Travel Carry On Hand Cabin Luggage with Beauty Case (Set of 2, White)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B4S16NVF?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Kono", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31CW346f51L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31CW346f51L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31CW346f51L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "26\" Medium Lightweight Expandable Suitcase Luggage Case Trolley Bag Travel", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00PYKGY06?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "FLYMAX", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31F0DG2l46L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31F0DG2l46L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31F0DG2l46L._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [": \n## Review: American Tourister Bon Air Spinner Suitcase 75 cm, 91 L, Black\nIf you're looking for a durable, lightweight, and secure suitcase, then the American Tourister Bon Air Spinner Suitcase 75 cm is perfect for you!
