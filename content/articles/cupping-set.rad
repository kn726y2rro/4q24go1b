The cups are placed on the skin and moved along the surface to create suction and compression. This action can help relieve pain and discomfort, as well as improve blood circulation and circulation. \nWhen it comes to choosing the best cupping set, there are a few things to consider. Here are some tips to help you choose the right set for your needs:\n1. Consider the material: Cupping sets can be made from glass or silicone. Glass cups are traditional and are often used in Chinese medicine. Silicone cups are more modern and are often used in Western medicine. Both types of cups have their advantages and disadvantages, so it's up to you to decide which one suits your needs best.\n2. Check the size: Make sure the cups in the set are the right size for your body. If they are too large, they may cause bruising or discomfort. If they are too small, they may not create enough suction to be effective.\n3. Consider the number of cups: Some cupping sets come with one cup, while others come with several cups. If you plan to use cupping on several areas of your body, you may want to consider a set with more cups.\n4. Look for safety features: Make sure the cupping set you choose has safety features such as suction cups that fit securely on the cups and silicone cups that are heat-resistant.\n5. Read reviews: Before making a purchase, read reviews from other customers to get an idea of the product's quality and effectiveness.\nBy following these tips, you can choose the best cupping set for your needs.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Premium Quality Cupping Set w/ 19 Cups ***BEST CUPPING SET IN KOREA***", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003KJC2F4?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "KS", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41G0YvNlEbL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41G0YvNlEbL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41G0YvNlEbL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "ASCLE Cupping Set w/Extra Thick Super Cup, 12-Cup", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MYZ8WHW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "ASCLE", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51B1xmLSOjL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51B1xmLSOjL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51B1xmLSOjL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Professional Cupping Set *Made in Korea* (17 Cups) with Extension Tube($3.00 Value) KS Choi Corp\"Made in Korea\"", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003D19U0O?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "K.S.
