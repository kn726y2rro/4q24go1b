Whether you have hard water stains, soap scum, or mildew, a good shower cleaner can help you keep your shower looking its best. But with so many different options available, how do you know which one is right for you? In this article, we'll explore some of the key factors to consider when choosing a shower cleaner.\n## Types of Shower Cleaners\nThere are a few different types of shower cleaners to choose from, including acid-based, bleach-based, and enzyme-based cleaners. Here's a brief overview of each:\n### Acid-Based Cleaners\nAcid-based shower cleaners use strong acids to break down soap scum, lime scale, and other types of mineral buildup in your shower. These cleaners can be very effective at removing stains, but they can also be harsh on your skin and can damage certain types of surfaces.\n### Bleach-Based Cleaners\nBleach-based shower cleaners use bleach to kill bacteria and remove stains from your shower. While these cleaners are generally safe to use, they can also be harsh on your skin and can damage certain types of surfaces.\n### Enzyme-Based Cleaners\nEnzyme-based shower cleaners use enzymes to break down soap scum and other types of buildup in your shower. These cleaners are generally considered to be the most gentle on your skin and on surfaces, and they can be effective at removing soap scum and other types of stains.\n## Factors to Consider\nWhen choosing a shower cleaner, there are a few key factors to consider, including the type of stains you have in your shower, the surface of your shower, and the safety of the cleaner for you and your family. Here are some things to consider:\n### Type of Stains\nThe first thing to consider is the type of stains in your shower. If you have hard water stains, you'll want a cleaner that is effective at breaking down mineral buildup. If you have soap scum or mildew, you'll want a cleaner that is safe for your skin and that can effectively remove these stains.\n### Surface of Your Shower\nNext, consider the surface of your shower. Some shower cleaners are safe for use on acrylic or ceramic surfaces, while others can damage these types of surfaces. Be sure to choose a cleaner that is safe for your shower surface.\n### Safety\nFinally, consider the safety of the cleaner for you and your family. Some shower cleaners can be harsh on your skin or can be toxic or allergenic if inhaled. Choose a cleaner that is safe for you to use and that won't harm your family or pets.\n## Conclusion\nChoosing the right shower cleaner can make a big difference in the cleanliness and appearance of your bathroom. By considering the type of stains, surface of your shower, and safety of the cleaner, you can choose a shower cleaner that is effective at removing stains and safe for you and your family.", "cool_products": [{"title": "Scrubbing Bubbles Mega Shower Foamer Disinfecting Spray, Multi-Surface Bathroom and Tile Cleaner Grime Fighter, Removes 100% Soap Scum, Rainshower Scent, 32 oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM5UH32?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Scrubbing Bubbles", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NrocdM1-L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NrocdM1-L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NrocdM1-L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Wet & Forget Shower Cleaner Weekly Application Requires No Scrubbing, Bleach-Free Formula, 64 Ounce (Pack of 1)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ENDOJ0G?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Wet & Forget", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41iyafkrLjL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41iyafkrLjL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41iyafkrLjL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Lysol Power Foaming Cleaning Spray for Bathrooms, Foam Cleaner for Bathrooms, Showers, Tubs, 32oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V9YYMK?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Lysol", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FOxBVgrfL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FOxBVgrfL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FOxBVgrfL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "CLR Brilliant Bath Foaming Bathroom Cleaner Spray - For Use On Toilet, Bath, Shower, Sink, Glass, Stainless Steel - Fresh Scent, 26 Ounce Bottle (Pack Of 2)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NRNM7G8?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "CLR", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41w2Ix72zbL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41w2Ix72zbL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41w2Ix72zbL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Scrubbing Bubbles Mega Shower Foamer Aerosol, Tough Foaming Bathroom, Tile, Bathtub and Disinfectant Shower Cleaner (1 Aerosol Spray), Rainshower Scent, 20 oz (Pack of 2)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B018FFHR98?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Scrubbing Bubbles", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DzhUYI1UL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DzhUYI1UL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DzhUYI1UL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Kaboom Shower Guard Daily Shower Cleaner, 30 fl oz (1)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J2DU2VI?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Kaboom", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41T-ltBD5BL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41T-ltBD5BL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41T-ltBD5BL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Scrubbing Bubbles Daily Shower and Bathroom Cleaner, Great on Tile, 32 oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016WFFGCI?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "SC Johnson", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yfYYPpR5L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yfYYPpR5L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yfYYPpR5L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "OxiClean Bathroom Cleaner, Shower, Tub & Tile, powered by OxiClean Stainfighters, 32oz.", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U7YNA7Y?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Kaboom", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eNZj3CcvL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eNZj3CcvL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eNZj3CcvL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Scrubbing Bubbles, Foaming Bleach Bathroom Cleaner, 32 oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AU03Y4Y?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Scrubbing Bubbles", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qr8GTQlUL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qr8GTQlUL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qr8GTQlUL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Stardrops - The Pink Stuff - Miracle Bathroom Foam Cleaner 750ml", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SFGCNCG?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Stardrops", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/317zZGI8h-L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/317zZGI8h-L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/317zZGI8h-L._SL500_.jpg"}], "cool_reviews": [":\nScrubbing Bubbles Mega Shower Foamer Disinfecting Spray is an exceptional bathroom and tile cleaner that deserves a place in every home.
