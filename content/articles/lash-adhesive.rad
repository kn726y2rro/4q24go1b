Without the right adhesive, your lashes will not stay in place all day, and you may end up with an unpleasant experience. Choosing the best lash adhesive can be a challenge, especially with so many options available in the market. Here are some tips to help you select the best lash adhesive for your needs.\n## What to Look for in a Lash Adhesive?\nBefore purchasing a lash adhesive, here are some things to consider:\n### Waterproof\nMost lash adhesives are waterproof, but some are water-resistant. If you plan to wear your lashes in the pool or shower, it's essential to choose a waterproof adhesive.\n### Hold Time\nThe hold time is the amount of time the adhesive will keep your lashes in place. Most lash adhesives have a hold time of 8-12 hours, but some can last up to 24 hours.\n### Drying Time\nDrying time is the amount of time it takes for the glue to become tacky and ready to be applied to your lashes. Most lash adhesives take 5-10 minutes to dry, but some can take as long as 30 minutes.\n### Smell and Toxins\nSome lash adhesives have a strong smell, which can be unpleasant. Also, avoid lash adhesives that contain toxins or harmful chemicals.\n## Types of Lash Adhesives\nThere are two types of lash adhesives:\n### Dual-side Adhesive\nThis type of lash adhesive has a sticky side that is applied to your eyelashes, and a separate adhesive that is applied to the false eyelashes. This type of adhesive is easy to apply and remove.\n### Single-side Adhesive\nThis type of lash adhesive has a single sided adhesive that is applied to your eyelashes and false eyelashes. This type of adhesive is more difficult to apply, but lasts longer.\n## Our Recommendation\nAfter considering the above factors, we recommend using the Revlon Lash Adhesive. This lash adhesive is waterproof and has a long hold time of up to 24 hours. It dries quickly and has a pleasant scent. It contains toxins and is easy to apply.\nWe hope this guide helps you choose the best lash adhesive for your needs. Remember to choose a waterproof adhesive with a long hold time and a pleasant scent.", "cool_products": [{"title": "KISS Clear Strip Lash Adhesive With Aloe, Waterproof, Formaldehyde and Latex Free, Odor Free, Cruelty Free, Super Strong Hold Eyelash Glue with Brush Applicator, 0.17 Oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BMMOAFU?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "KISS", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41RH+KsNzoS._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41RH+KsNzoS._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41RH+KsNzoS._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "i-Envy by KISS Super Strong Eyelash Adhesive Clear KPEG06 Brush On Latex Free", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RH8XUZK?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "KISS", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ywEIr4LGL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ywEIr4LGL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ywEIr4LGL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Ardell LashTite Lash Adhesive Dark for Individual Lashes, 0.125 oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OD4R1Q?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "Ardell", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31O945PR0-L._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31O945PR0-L._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31O945PR0-L._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Lash Glue Lash Extension Glue 1-2s Fast Drying Strong Hold Clear Glue Long Lasting Glue Waterproof Eye Lash Glue Lash Extension Low Irritation Glue Sensitive Lash Glue for Professional Use(Clear-5ml)", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C13ZB9SW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "WENDY LASHES", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/313muiiSBpL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/313muiiSBpL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/313muiiSBpL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "i-Envy by KISS Super Strong Hold Eyelash Adhesive Black KPEG05 Brush On Latex Free 0.18oz", "clickurl": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RH8W9KW?tag=wvf6tvg6e849vru4-20", "brand": "KISS", "image_s": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41E8XiHw-nL._SL75_.jpg", "image_m": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41E8XiHw-nL._SL160_.jpg", "image_l": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41E8XiHw-nL._SL500_.jpg"}, {"title": "Extra Powerful Eyelash Extension Glue -
